Text Alignment Network version 1, development release

For more about TAN visit http://textalign.net.

This being a development release, all files are subject to change. Quite
a lot of work remains before the TAN format can be used widely and reliably.
Files valid one day might be rendered invalid the next. If you begin to 
work with the format and develop ideas, we would welcome your input and
contributions.

The best place to start is guidelines/, followed by examples/. The other
three subdirectories -- functions/, schemas/, and TAN-R-tok/ -- carry
the core files needed for validation.
