Text Alignment Network version 1, development release

http://textalign.net

This project has submodules, which must be invoked using the --recursive option:
`git clone --recursive [PATH]`

All files are subject to change. Participation in developing the guidelines is welcome.

The best place to start is guidelines/ (see also http://textalign.net/release/TAN-1-dev/guidelines/xhtml/index.xhtml), 
followed by examples/. The other three subdirectories -- functions/, schemas/, and TAN-key/ -- carry
the core files needed for validation.

For other TAN libraries see http://textalign.net.
