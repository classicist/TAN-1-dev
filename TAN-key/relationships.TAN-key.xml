                <desc>Two TAN files are different editions if they are genetically related to each
                    other, but neither one supersedes the other. They share a common editorial
                    history and treats the same basic material but with a different approach.
                    Neither inherently supersedes the other. If they share a common ancestry, they
                    stand in different branches of that ancestry. Editions must not have the same
                    TAN id. They normally differ in the content of &lt;source&gt; or
                    &lt;declarations&gt; or both.</desc>

                            same textual object, but divides that transcription into a different
                            reference system. If this value is invoked, the concatenated text
                            content of &lt;body&gt; must be identical, after space normalization.
                            This &lt;relationship&gt; is useful for developing a concordance between
                            alternative reference systems for the same text.</desc>

                            be valuable in cases where normalization standards for a particular
                            language are not settled, and users may prefer one convention over the
                            other, but wish to have access to another approach to
                            normalization.</desc>

                <desc>One TAN file is a version of another if it derives from it (either directly or
                    through a chain of versions) and if the later version supersedes the older one.
                    Versions of a TAN file stand on a linear path of editorial labor. Differences
                    tend to be minor and reflect a progressive effort to correct errors. Versions
                    have the same TAN id and are distinguished exclusively by the latest
                    ISO-compliant date (see @when and @ed-when).</desc>
