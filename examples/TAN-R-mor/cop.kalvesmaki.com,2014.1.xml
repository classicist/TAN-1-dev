               negative and positive variants and cover all lexical material preceding the subject
               noun or pronoun, e.g.: (1) ⲁ|ϥ|ⲥⲱⲧⲙ̄ (3rd person masculine past tense) (2) ⲁⲣⲉ|ⲥⲱⲧⲙ̄

               tense) Note that when used with pronominal subjects, the optative and conditional
               conjugation encompass the subject pronoun, leading to a portmanteau tag like
               AOPT_PPERS (or A_PPER in the coarse grained tagset): (4) ⲉϥⲉ/AOPT_PPERS ⲥⲱⲧⲙ̄

               tagged as articles (see PPOS) and relative articles like ⲡ|ⲉⲧ are segmented to
               contain a relative converter (see C and CREL). Articles followed by a noun beginning
               with ϩ and consequently spelled ⲑ or ⲫ e.g. ⲑⲉ ‘the way’ are normalized and tokenized
               as ⲧ and ϩⲉ before part-of-speech tagging, so that ⲧ etc. can be tagged as an article
               alone (see segmentation guidelines). </desc>

            <desc>Examples: ⲉ, ⲉⲧⲉ, ⲛⲉ, ... The class of converters, which is syntactically
               heterogeneous, is described in Layton (2004: 319-366). It includes four types of
               converters which have several realizations depending on their syntactic environment.
               In the coarse tagset, all converters are tagged as C, allowing for lower error rates
               in automatic tagging (especially by removing the distinction between circumstantial
               and relative conversions, which can be ambiguous). The examples below are for the
               four fine grained classes: CCIRC Converter, circumstantial ⲉ, ⲉ[ⲁ], ⲉⲣⲉ CFOC
               Converter, focalizing (a.k.a. 2nd tenses) ⲉ, ⲉⲣⲉ, ⲉⲧⲉ, ⲛ̄ⲧ[ⲁ], ⲉⲛⲧ[ⲁ] CPRET
               Converter, preterite ⲛⲉ, ⲛⲉⲣⲉ CREL Converter, relative ⲉⲧⲉ, ⲉⲧ, ⲛ̄ⲧ[ⲁ], ⲉⲛⲧ[ⲁ], ⲉⲧⲉⲣⲉ
               Note that a following conjugation base is segmented separately from the converter
               (cf. segmentation guidelines), e.g.: (16) ⲛⲧ/CREL ⲁ/APST ϥ|ⲥⲙⲟⲩ ‘which he blessed’
               The converter includes only ⲛⲧ, while ⲁ is a separate auxiliary base. </desc>

               and Egyptian origin which link phrases and clauses. No distinction is made between
               subordinating conjunctions which introduce clauses (‘because’, ‘lest’) and
               coordinating conjunctions which connect phrases (e.g. ‘and’, ‘or’). (17) ⲁⲩⲱ/CONJ
               ⲁⲓⲉⲓⲃⲉⲩ ‘and I became thirsty’ (18) ⲉⲓϫⲱ ⲙ̅ⲙⲟⲥ ϫⲉ/CONJ ⲙⲏⲡⲟⲧⲉ/CONJ ⲧⲁⲉⲓⲃⲉ ‘saying
               [that:] lest I become thirsty’ In the first example, the coordinating conjunction ⲁⲩⲱ
               ‘and’ appears. Note that it is still tagged as a conjunction even if the first
               coordinated phrase is missing. In the second example, two consecutive conjunctions
               appear: ϫⲉ ‘that, saying’ introduces the direct speech and the Greek origin ⲙⲏⲡⲟⲧⲉ
               ‘lest’ is a conjunction within the direct speech clause. Also note that the word ϫⲉ,
               originally derived from ϫⲱ ‘say’ is not considered a verb in this usage. </desc>

            <name>Copula</name>
            <desc>Examples: ⲡⲉ/ⲧⲉ/ⲛⲉ Copulas are markers in so-called nominal sentences which
               express predications of the sort A is B. The copula forms are ⲡⲉ/ⲧⲉ/ⲛⲉ. The tag COP
               is given also to copulas following a verbal clause for focalizing emphasis (i.e. ‘it
               is the case that…’), as illustrated below. (19) ⲟⲩⲥⲁⲉⲓⲛ ⲡⲉ/COP ‘he is a doctor’ (20)
               ⲛⲉϥⲧⲱⲃϩ ⲙⲡϫⲟⲉⲓⲥ ⲡⲉ/COP ‘(it is that) he prayed to God’ In the latter example, it is
               less obvious that ⲡⲉ is the copula, as its predicate is formally a clause and the
               form never changes its gender or number (i.e. as ⲧⲉ/ⲛⲉ; this is also referred to as
               ‘invariable ⲡⲉ’). Though the English translation cannot convey the presence of the
               copula adequately, these types of cases are still tagged as COP (see Layton
               2004:223). </desc>

               grammatical object. For compound verbs (see §180 in Layton), the entire compund is
               considered “a single unit in boundness, syntax, and meaning.” Therefore, the entire
               compound is tagged V. The components of the compound may be annotated further on a
               morph level annotation. (See Transcription guidelines for more information on bound
               groups, morphemes, and word segmentation.) Common examples include compound verbs
               formed with ϯ-, ⲣ-, and ϫⲓ-. (60) ⲉⲧ/CREL ⲣⲛⲟⲃⲉ/V (61) ⲉ/CCIRC ⲕ/PPERS ϯⲥⲃⲱ/V </desc>

            <desc>Examples: ⲛⲁⲛⲟⲩ[ϥ], ⲡⲉϫⲁ[ϥ], ⲡⲉϫⲉ,... The category VBD is given to a small class
               of suffixally inflected predicates described in Layton (2004: 297-304), including the
               common ⲡⲉϫⲉ-/ⲡⲉϫⲁ⸗ ‘say’, ⲛⲁⲛⲟⲩ⸗ ‘be good’ etc., but not including possessive
               existentials of the type ⲟⲩⲛⲧⲉ- (see the tag EXIST). The personal suffix following a
               VBD is tagged as its subject, i.e. PPERS (or simply PPER in the coarse tagset). (62)
