      <div type="p" n="1">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1"> SECTION 1 Part 1 Things are said to</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">be named 'equivocally' when, though they have a common name, the
               definition corresponding with the</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">name differs for each. Thus, a real man and a figure in a picture
               can</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">both lay claim to the name 'animal'; yet these are</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">equivocally so named, for, though they have a common name, the</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">definition corresponding with the name differs for each. For should
               any</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">one define in what sense each is an animal, his definition in the
               one case</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">will be appropriate to that case only. On the other hand,</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">things are said to be named 'univocally' which have both</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">the name and the definition answering to the name in common.</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">A man and an ox are both 'animal', and these</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">are univocally so named, inasmuch as not only the name, but also
               the definition, is</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">the same in both cases: for if a man should state in what sense
               each</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">is an animal, the statement in the one case would</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">be identical with that</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">in the other. Things are said to be named</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">'derivatively', which derive their name from some other name,
               but</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">differ from it in termination. Thus the grammarian derives his
               name</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">from the word 'grammar', and the courageous</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">man from the word 'courage'. Part 2 Forms of speech</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">are either simple or composite. Examples of the latter are such
               expressions as 'the man runs',</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">'the man wins'; of the former 'man', 'ox', 'runs', 'wins'. Of
               things themselves some are predicable of</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">a subject, and are never present in a subject. Thus 'man' is
               predicable of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">individual man, and is never present in a subject. By being</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are present
               in a</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said
               subject. Some things, again,</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">are present in a subject, but are never predicable of a subject.
               For instance, a certain</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">point of grammatical knowledge is present in the mind, but is</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">not predicable of any subject; or again, a certain whiteness may be
               present in the</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">body (for colour requires a material basis), yet it is never
               predicable of anything. Other things,</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">again, are both predicable of a subject and present in a subject.
               Thus while</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">knowledge is present in the human mind, it is predicable of grammar.
               There is, lastly, a</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">class of things which are neither present in a subject nor
               predicable of a</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">subject, such as the individual man or the individual horse. But, to
               speak more generally,</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">that which is individual and has the character of a unit is never
               predicable of</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">a subject. Yet in some cases there is nothing to prevent such being
               present in a</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">subject. Thus a certain point of grammatical knowledge is present in
               a subject. Part 3</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">When one thing</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">is predicated of another, all that which is predicable of the
               predicate will be</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">predicable also of the subject. Thus, 'man' is predicated of the
               individual man; but 'animal'</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">is predicated of 'man'; it will, therefore, be predicable of the
               individual man also: for</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">the individual man is both 'man' and 'animal'. If genera are
               different and co-ordinate, their differentiae</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">are themselves different in kind. Take as an instance the genus
               'animal' and the genus</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">'knowledge'. 'With feet', 'two-footed', 'winged', 'aquatic', are
               differentiae of 'animal'; the species of knowledge</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">are not distinguished by the same differentiae. One species
               of</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">knowledge does not differ from another in being 'two-footed'. But
               where</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">one genus is subordinate to another, there is nothing to</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">prevent their having the same differentiae: for the greater class
               is predicated of the lesser, so</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">that all the differentiae of the predicate will be differentiae
               also</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">of the subject. Part 4 Expressions which are in no way composite
               signify substance, quantity,</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, or
               affection. To</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">sketch my meaning roughly, examples of substance are 'man' or
               'the</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">horse', of quantity, such</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">terms as 'two cubits long' or 'three cubits long', of</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">quality, such attributes as 'white', 'grammatical'. 'Double',
               'half', 'greater', fall under the category of relation; 'in</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">a the market place', 'in the Lyceum', under that of place;
               'yesterday', 'last year', under</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">that of time. 'Lying', 'sitting', are terms indicating position,
               'shod', 'armed', state; 'to lance', 'to</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">cauterize', action; 'to be lanced', 'to be cauterized', affection.
               No one of these terms,</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="2">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">in and by itself, involves an affirmation; it is by the combination
               of such terms that</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">positive or negative statements arise. For every assertion must, as
               is admitted, be either true or</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">false, whereas expressions which are not in any way composite such
               as 'man', 'white', 'runs', 'wins',</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">cannot be either true or false. Part 5 Substance, in the truest and
               primary and most</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">definite sense of the word, is that which is neither predicable of a
               subject nor</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">present in a subject; for instance, the individual man or horse. But
               in a</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">secondary sense those things are called substances within which,
               as</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">species, the primary substances are included; also those
               which,</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">as genera, include the species. For instance, the individual man
               is</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">included in the species 'man', and the</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">genus to which the species belongs is 'animal'; these,
               therefore-that</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">is to say, the species 'man' and the genus 'animal,-are</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">termed secondary substances. It is plain from what has been said
               that both the name and</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">the definition of the predicate must be predicable of the subject.
               For instance, 'man' is predicted</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">of the individual man. Now in this case the name of the species
               man'</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">is applied to the individual, for we use the term 'man' in
               describing the individual; and</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">the definition of 'man' will also be predicated of the individual
               man, for the</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">individual man is both man and animal. Thus, both the name and the
               definition of</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">the species are predicable of the individual. With regard, on the
               other hand, to those</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">things which are present in a subject, it is generally the case
               that neither their</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">name nor their definition is predicable of that in which they are
               present. Though, however,</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">the definition is never predicable, there is nothing in certain
               cases to prevent the name</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">being used. For instance, 'white' being present in a body is
               predicated of that in which</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">it is present, for a body is called white: the definition, however,
               of the colour</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">white' is never predicable of the body. Everything except primary
               substances is either predicable of</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">a primary substance or present in a primary substance. This becomes
               evident by reference</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">to particular instances which occur. 'Animal' is predicated of the
               species 'man', therefore of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">individual man, for if there were no individual man of whom it
               could be</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">predicated, it could not be predicated of the species 'man' at all.
               Again, colour is present</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">in body, therefore in individual bodies, for if there were no
               individual body in which</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">it was present, it could not be present in body at all. Thus
               everything</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">except primary substances is either predicated of primary
               substances, or is present in them, and</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">if these last did not exist, it would be impossible for anything
               else to exist.</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">Of secondary substances, the species is more truly substance than
               the genus, being more nearly</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">related to primary substance. For if any one should render an
               account of what a primary</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">substance is, he would render a more instructive account, and
               one</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">more proper to the subject, by stating the species than</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">by stating the genus. Thus, he would give a more instructive
               account of an</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">individual man by stating that he was man than by</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">stating that he was animal, for the former description is</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">peculiar to the individual in a greater degree, while the</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">latter is too general. Again, the man who gives an</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">account of the nature of an individual tree will give a</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">more instructive account by mentioning the species 'tree' than
               by</div>
            <div type="l" n="6a">mentioning the genus 'plant'. Moreover, primary substances are most
               properly called</div>
            <div type="l" n="6b">substances in virtue of the fact that they are the entities</div>
            <div type="l" n="6c">which underlie every. else, and that</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">everything else is either predicated of them or present in</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">them. Now the same relation which subsists between primary substance
               and everything else subsists also</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">between the species and the genus: for the species is to the genus
               as subject</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">is to predicate, since the genus is predicated of the species,
               whereas the species cannot</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">be predicated of the genus. Thus we have a second ground for
               asserting that</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">the species is more truly substance than the genus. Of species
               themselves, except in</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">the case of such as are genera, no one is more truly substance than
               another. We</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">should not give a more appropriate account of the individual man by
               stating the species</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">to which he belonged, than we should of an individual horse by
               adopting the same</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">method of definition. In the same way, of primary substances, no
               one is more</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">truly substance than another; an individual man is not more truly
               substance than an individual</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">ox. It is, then, with good reason that of all</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">that remains, when we exclude primary substances, we concede to
               species</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">and genera alone the name 'secondary substance', for these alone
               of</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">all the predicates convey a knowledge of primary substance. For it
               is by stating the</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">species or the genus that we appropriately define any individual
               man; and we shall make</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">our definition more exact by stating the former than by stating the
               latter. All other</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">things that we state, such as that he is white, that he runs, and
               so on,</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">are irrelevant to the definition. Thus it is just that these alone,
               apart from</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">primary substances, should be called substances. Further, primary
               substances are most properly so called, because</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">they underlie and are the subjects of everything else. Now the same
               relation that subsists between</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">primary substance and everything</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">else subsists also between the species and the genus to</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">which the primary substance belongs, on the one hand, and
               every</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">attribute which is not included within these, on the other.</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">For these are the subjects of all such. If we call an individual
               man 'skilled in</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">grammar', the predicate is applicable also to the species and to
               the genus to which he</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">belongs. This law holds good in all cases. It</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">is a common characteristic of all sub. stance that it is</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">never present in a subject. For primary substance is neither
               present in a subject nor predicated</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">of a subject; while, with regard to secondary substances, it</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">is clear from the following arguments (apart from others) that they
               are not present</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="3">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">in a subject. For 'man' is predicated of the individual man,</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">but is not present in any subject: for manhood is not present in the
               individual man.</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">In the same way, 'animal' is also predicated of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">individual man, but is not present in him. Again, when a</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">thing is present in a subject, though the name may quite well be
               applied</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">to that in which it</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">is present, the definition cannot be applied. Yet of secondary</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">substances, not only the name, but also the definition, applies to
               the subject: we should</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">use both the definition of the species and that of the genus with
               reference to</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">the individual man. Thus substance cannot be present in a subject.
               Yet this is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">peculiar to substance, for it is also the case that differentiae
               cannot be present in</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">subjects. The characteristics 'terrestrial' and 'two-footed' are
               predicated of the species 'man', but not present in</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">it. For they are not in man. Moreover, the definition of the
               differentia may be</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">predicated of that of which the differentia itself is predicated.
               For</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">instance, if the characteristic 'terrestrial' is predicated of the
               species 'man',</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">the definition also of that characteristic may be used to
               form</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">the predicate of the species 'man': for 'man' is terrestrial. The
               fact that the parts</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">of substances appear to be present in the whole, as in a subject,
               should not</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">make us apprehensive lest we should have to admit that such parts
               are not</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">substances: for in explaining the phrase 'being present in a
               subject', we stated' that</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">we meant 'otherwise than as parts in a whole'. It is</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">the mark of substances and of differentiae that, in</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">all propositions of which they form the predicate, they are
               predicated univocally. For all such</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">propositions have for their subject either the individual or the
               species. It is true that, inasmuch</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">as primary substance is not predicable of anything, it can never
               form the predicate of any</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">proposition. But of secondary substances, the species is predicated
               of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">individual, the genus both of the species and of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">individual. Similarly the differentiae are predicated of the
               species and of the individuals. Moreover, the definition</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">of the species and that of the genus are applicable to the primary
               substance,</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">and that of the genus to the species. For all that is predicated of
               the</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">predicate will be predicated also of the subject. Similarly, the
               definition of the differentiae</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">will be applicable to the species and to</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">the individuals. But it was stated above that the word</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">'univocal' was applied to those things which had both name
               and</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">definition in common. It is, therefore, established that in
               every</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">proposition, of which either substance or a differentia forms the
               predicate,</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">these are predicated univocally. All substance appears to signify
               that which is individual. In the case</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">of primary substance this is indisputably true, for the thing is a
               unit. In</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">the case of secondary substances, when we speak, for instance, of
               'man' or 'animal', our form</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">of speech gives the impression that we are here also
               indicating</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">that which is individual, but the impression is not strictly
               true;</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">for a secondary substance is not an individual, but a class with a
               certain qualification;</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">for it is not one and single as a primary substance is; the words
               'man', 'animal',</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">are predicable of more than one subject. Yet species and genus</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">do not merely indicate quality, like the term 'white'; 'white'</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">indicates quality and nothing further, but species and genus
               determine the</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">quality with reference to a substance: they signify substance
               qualitatively</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">differentiated. The determinate qualification covers a larger</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">field in the case of the genus that in that</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">of the species: he who uses the word 'animal' is</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">herein using a word of wider extension than he who uses the word
               'man'. Another</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">mark of substance is that it has no contrary. What could be the
               contrary of any</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">primary substance, such as the individual man or animal? It has
               none. Nor can the</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">species or the genus have a contrary. Yet this characteristic</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">is not peculiar to substance, but is true of many other things,
               such as quantity. There</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">is nothing that forms the contrary of 'two cubits long'</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">or of 'three cubits long', or of 'ten', or of any such term. A
               man</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">may contend that 'much' is the contrary of 'little', or
               'great'</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">of 'small', but of definite quantitative terms no contrary exists.
               Substance, again, does not appear</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">to admit of variation of degree. I do not mean by this that one
               substance</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">cannot be more or less truly substance than another, for it has
               already been stated' that this</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">is the case; but that</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">no single substance admits of varying degrees within itself.
               For</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">instance, one particular substance, 'man', cannot be more or less
               man</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">either than himself at some other time or than some other man. One
               man cannot be</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">more man than another, as that which is white may be more or less
               white than some</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">other white object, or as that which is beautiful may be more or
               less beautiful than some</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">other beautiful object. The same quality, moreover, is said to
               subsist in a thing in varying</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">degrees at different times. A body, being white, is said to be
               whiter at one time</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">than it was before, or, being warm, is said to</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">be warmer or less warm than at some other time.</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">But substance is not said to be more or less that which it is: a
               man</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">is not more truly a man at one time than</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">he was before, nor is anything, if it is substance,</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">more or less what it is. Substance, then, does not admit</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">of variation of degree. The most distinctive mark of substance
               appears to be that,</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">while remaining numerically one and the same, it is capable of
               admitting contrary qualities. From</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="4">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">among things other than substance, we should find ourselves unable
               to bring forward any which</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">possessed this mark. Thus, one and the same colour cannot be white
               and black.</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">Nor can the same one action be good and bad:</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">this law holds good with everything that is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">substance. But one and the selfsame substance, while retaining
               its</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">identity, is yet capable of admitting contrary qualities. The
               same</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">individual person is at one time white, at another black,</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">at one time warm, at another cold, at one time</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">good, at</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">another bad. This capacity is found nowhere else, though it</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">might be maintained that a statement or opinion was an exception to
               the rule. The same</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">statement, it is agreed, can be both true and false.</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">For if the statement 'he is sitting' is true, yet, when</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">the person in question has risen, the same statement will be</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">false. The same applies to opinions. For if any one thinks</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">truly that a person is sitting, yet, when that person</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">has risen, this same opinion, if still held, will be</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">false. Yet although this exception may be allowed, there is,
               nevertheless, a difference in the</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">manner in which the thing takes place. It is by themselves changing
               that substances admit</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">contrary qualities. It is thus that that which was hot becomes
               cold, for it</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">has entered into a different state. Similarly that which was white
               becomes black, and that</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">which was bad good, by a process of change; and in the same
               way</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">in all other cases it is by changing that substances are capable of
               admitting contrary</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">qualities. But statements and opinions themselves remain unaltered
               in all respects: it is by the</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">alteration in the facts of the case that the contrary quality comes
               to be</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">theirs. The statement 'he is sitting' remains unaltered, but it is
               at one time true,</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">at another false, according to circumstances. What has been said of
               statements applies also to opinions.</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">Thus, in respect of the manner in which the thing takes place, it
               is the</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">peculiar mark of substance that it should be capable of admitting
               contrary qualities; for it</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">is by itself changing that it does so. If, then, a man should make
               this</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">exception and contend that statements and opinions are capable of
               admitting</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">contrary qualities, his contention is unsound. For statements and
               opinions are said to have</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">this capacity, not because they themselves undergo modification,
               but because this modification occurs in</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">the case of something else. The truth or falsity of a statement
               depends on facts, and</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">not on any power on the part of the statement</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">itself of admitting contrary qualities. In short, there is nothing
               which can alter the nature of</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">statements and opinions. As, then, no change takes place in
               themselves, these cannot be said</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">to be capable of admitting contrary qualities. But it is by reason
               of the modification</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">which takes place within the substance itself that a substance
               is</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">said to be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for a
               substance</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">admits within itself either disease or health, whiteness or
               blackness. It is in this sense</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">that it is said to be capable of admitting contrary qualities. To
               sum up, it is</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">a distinctive mark of substance, that, while remaining numerically
               one and the same, it is</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">capable of admitting contrary qualities, the modification taking
               place through a change in the substance</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">itself. Let these remarks suffice on the subject of substance.
               Part</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">6 Quantity is either discrete or continuous. Moreover, some
               quantities are such that each part</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">of the whole has a relative position to the other parts: others
               have within them</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">no such relation of part to part. Instances of discrete quantities
               are number and speech; of</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">continuous, lines, surfaces, solids, and, besides these, time and
               place. In the case of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">parts of a number, there is no common boundary at which they join.
               For example: two</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">fives make ten, but the two fives have no common</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">boundary, but are separate; the parts three and seven also do</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">not join at any boundary. Nor, to generalize, would it ever be
               possible in the</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">case of number that there should be a common boundary among the
               parts; they are always</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">separate. Number, therefore, is a discrete quantity. The same is
               true of speech. That speech</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">is</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">a quantity is evident: for it is measured in long</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">and short syllables. I mean here that speech which is vocal.</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">Moreover, it is a discrete quantity for its parts have no common
               boundary. There is no</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">common boundary at which the syllables join, but each is separate
               and distinct from the</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">rest. A line, on the other hand, is a continuous</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">quantity, for it is possible to find a common boundary at</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">which its parts join. In the case of the line, this common boundary
               is the</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">point; in the case of the plane, it is the line: for the parts
               of</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">the plane have also a common boundary. Similarly you can find</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">a common boundary in the case of the parts of a</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">solid, namely either a line or a plane. Space and time</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">also belong to this class of quantities. Time, past, present, and
               future, forms a continuous</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">whole. Space, likewise, is a continuous quantity; for the parts
               of</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">a solid occupy a certain space, and these have a common boundary;
               it follows that the</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">parts of space also, which are occupied by the parts of the solid,
               have</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">the same common boundary as the parts of the solid. Thus, not only
               time, but</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">space also, is a continuous quantity, for its parts have a common
               boundary. Quantities consist either</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">of parts which bear a relative position each to each, or of
               parts</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="5">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">which do not. The parts of a line bear a relative</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">position to each other, for each lies somewhere, and it would be
               possible to distinguish</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">each, and to state the position of each on the plane and to explain
               to</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">what sort of part among the rest each was contiguous.
               Similarly</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">the parts of a plane have position, for it could similarly</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">be stated what was the position of each and what sort</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">of parts were contiguous. The same is true with regard to the solid
               and to</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">space. But it would be impossible to show that the arts</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">of a number had a relative position each to each, or a particular
               position, or</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">to state what parts were contiguous. Nor could this be done in the
               case of</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">time, for none of the parts of time has an abiding</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">existence, and that which does not abide can hardly have position.
               It would be better</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">to say that such parts had a relative order, in virtue of one
               being</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">prior to another. Similarly with number: in counting, 'one'</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">is prior to 'two', and 'two' to 'three', and</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">thus the parts of number may be said to possess a</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">relative order, though it would be impossible to discover any
               distinct position for each. This</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">holds good also in the case of speech. None of its parts has an
               abiding</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">existence: when once a syllable is pronounced, it is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">possible to retain it, so that, naturally, as the parts do</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">not abide, they cannot have position. Thus, some quantities consist
               of parts which have position,</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">and some of those which have not. Strictly speaking, only the
               things which I have</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">mentioned belong to the category of quantity: everything else that
               is</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">called quantitative is a quantity in a secondary sense. It is</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">because we have in mind some one of these quantities,</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">properly so called, that we apply quantitative terms to other</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">things. We speak of what is white as large, because the surface
               over which the</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">white extends is large; we speak of an action or a</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">process as lengthy, because the time covered is long; these things
               cannot in their own</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">right claim the quantitative epithet. For instance, should any one
               explain how long an action</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">was, his statement would be made in terms of the time taken, to the
               effect that</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">it lasted a year, or something of that sort. In</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">the same way, he would explain the size of a</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">white object in terms of surface, for he would state the</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">area which it covered. Thus the things already mentioned, and these
               alone, are in their intrinsic</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">nature quantities; nothing else can claim the name in its own
               right, but, if</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">at all, only in a secondary sense.</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">Quantities have no contraries. In the case of definite
               quantities</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">this is obvious; thus, there is nothing that is the contrary
               of</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">'two cubits long' or of 'three cubits long', or of a</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">surface, or of any such quantities. A man might, indeed, argue that
               'much' was the contrary</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">of 'little', and 'great' of 'small'. But these are not quantitative,
               but relative; things are</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">not great or small absolutely, they are so called rather as the
               result of an act</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">of comparison. For instance, a mountain is called small, a
               grain</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">large, in virtue of the fact that the latter is greater</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">than others of its kind, the former less. Thus there is a reference
               here to</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">an external standard, for if the terms 'great' and 'small'
               were</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">used absolutely, a mountain would never be called small or a grain
               large. Again, we say</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">that there are many people in</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">a village, and few in Athens, although those in the</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">city are many times as numerous as those in the village:</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">or we say that a house has many in it, and</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">a theatre few, though those in the theatre far outnumber</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">those in the house. The terms 'two cubits long, "three</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">cubits long,' and so on indicate quantity, the terms 'great'
               and</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">'small' indicate relation, for they have reference to an external
               standard. It is, therefore,</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">plain that these are to be classed as relative. Again, whether we
               define them as</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">quantitative or not, they have no contraries: for how can there be
               a contrary</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">of an attribute which is not to be apprehended in or by itself, but
               only by</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">reference to something external? Again, if 'great' and 'small'
               are</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">contraries, it will come about that the same subject can
               admit</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">contrary qualities at one and the same time, and that things</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">will themselves be contrary to themselves. For it happens at</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">times that the same thing is both small and great. For</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">the same thing may be small in comparison with one thing,</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">and great in comparison with another, so that the same thing</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">comes to be both small and great at one and the</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">same time, and is of such a nature as to admit contrary qualities
               at one</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">and the same moment. Yet it was agreed, when substance was being
               discussed, that nothing admits</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">contrary qualities at one and the same moment. For though substance
               is capable of admitting</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">contrary qualities, yet no one is at the same time both sick and
               healthy, nothing</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">is at the same time both white and black. Nor is there anything
               which</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">is qualified in contrary ways at one and the same time.</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">Moreover, if these were contraries, they would themselves be
               contrary</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">to themselves. For if 'great' is the contrary of 'small', and the
               same thing is</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">both great and small at the same time, then 'small' or 'great' is
               the contrary</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">of itself. But this is impossible. The term 'great', therefore, is
               not the contrary of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">term 'small', nor 'much' of 'little'. And even though a man should
               call these terms</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="6">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">not relative but quantitative, they would not have contraries. It is
               in the case of</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">space that quantity most plausibly appears to admit of a contrary.
               For men define the</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">term 'above' as the contrary of 'below', when it is</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">the region at the centre they mean by 'below';</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">and this is so, because nothing is farther from the
               extremities</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">of the universe than the region at the centre. Indeed, it</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">seems that in defining contraries of every kind men have</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">recourse to a spatial metaphor, for they say that those things</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">are contraries which, within the same class, are separated by</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">the greatest possible distance. Quantity does not, it appears,
               admit of</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">variation of degree. One thing cannot be two cubits long in a
               greater degree than another.</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">Similarly with regard to number: what is 'three' is not more truly
               three than what is</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">'five' is five; nor is one set of three more truly</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">three than another set. Again, one period of time is not said to be
               more</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">truly time than another. Nor is there any other kind of quantity,
               of all that have</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">been mentioned, with regard to which variation of degree can</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">be predicated. The category of</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">quantity, therefore, does not admit of variation of degree.
               The</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">most distinctive mark of quantity is that equality and inequality
               are predicated of it. Each</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">of the aforesaid quantities is said to be equal or unequal. For
               instance, one solid is</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">said to be equal or unequal to another; number, too, and time can
               have these terms applied</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">to them, indeed can all those kinds of quantity that have been
               mentioned. That which</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">is not a quantity can by no means, it would seem, be termed equal
               or unequal</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">to anything else. One particular disposition or one particular
               quality,</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">such as whiteness, is by no means compared with another in terms of
               equality and</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">inequality but rather in terms of similarity. Thus it is the
               distinctive mark of</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">quantity that it can be called equal and unequal.

            <div type="l" n="28a">2 Part 7 Those things are called relative, which, being either
               said to be of</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">something else or related to something else, are explained by
               reference</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">to that other thing. For instance, the word 'superior' is</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">explained by reference to something else, for it is
               superiority</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">over something else that is meant. Similarly, the expression
               'double' has this external reference, for</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">it is the double of something else that is meant. So it is with
               everything else</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">of this kind. There are, moreover, other relatives, e.g. habit,
               disposition, perception, knowledge, and attitude.</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">The significance of all these is explained by a</div>

            <div type="l" n="37">a habit is a habit of something, knowledge is knowledge of</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">something, attitude is the attitude of something. So it is with all
               other relatives that have</div>

               which is called similar must be similar</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">to something else, and all other such attributes have this</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">external reference. It is to be noted that lying and standing and
               sitting are particular</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">attitudes, but attitude is itself a relative term. To lie, to stand,
               to be seated, are</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">not themselves attitudes, but take their name from the aforesaid
               attitudes. It is possible</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">for relatives to have contraries. Thus virtue has a contrary, vice,
               these both being relatives; knowledge,</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">too, has a contrary, ignorance. But this is not the mark of all
               relatives; 'double' and</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">'triple' have no contrary, nor indeed has any such term. It also
               appears that relatives</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">can admit of variation of degree. For 'like' and 'unlike', 'equal'
               and 'unequal', have the</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">modifications 'more' and 'less' applied to them, and each of these
               is relative in character: for the</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">terms 'like' and 'unequal' bear 'unequal' bear a reference to
               something external. Yet, again,</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">it is not every relative term that admits of variation of
               degree.</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">No term such as 'double' admits of this modification. All</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">relatives have correlatives: by the term 'slave' we mean the slave
               of a master, by</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">the term 'master', the master of a slave; by 'double', the double
               of its hall;</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">by 'half', the half of its double; by 'greater', greater</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">than that which is less; by 'less,' less than that which is
               greater. So it</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">is with every other relative term; but the case we use to express
               the</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">correlation differs in some instances. Thus, by knowledge we mean
               knowledge</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">the knowable; by the knowable, that which is to be</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">apprehended by knowledge; by perception, perception of the
               perceptible; by the perceptible, that which is</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">apprehended by perception. Sometimes, however, reciprocity of
               correlation does not appear</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">to exist. This comes about when a blunder is made, and that to
               which</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">the relative</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">is related is not accurately stated. If a man states that</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">a wing is necessarily relative to a bird, the connexion between
               these two will</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">not be reciprocal, for it will not be possible to say that a bird
               is a</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">bird by reason of its wings. The reason is that the original
               statement was inaccurate, for</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">the wing is not said to be relative to the bird qua bird, since
               many</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">creatures besides birds have wings, but qua winged creature. If,
               then, the statement is made</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">accurate, the connexion will be reciprocal, for we can speak
               of</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">a wing, having reference necessarily to a winged creature, and of a
               winged creature as being</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">such because of its wings. Occasionally, perhaps, it is necessary
               to coin words, if no</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">word exists by which a correlation can adequately be explained.
               If</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">we define a rudder as necessarily having reference to a</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">boat, our definition will not be appropriate, for the rudder does
               not have this reference to</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="7">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">a boat qua boat, as there are boats which have no rudders. Thus we
               cannot</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">use the terms reciprocally, for the word 'boat' cannot be said</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">to find its explanation in the word 'rudder'. As there is no
               existing word, our</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">definition would perhaps be more accurate if we coined some word
               like 'ruddered' as the correlative</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">of 'rudder'. If we express ourselves thus accurately, at any rate
               the terms are reciprocally</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">connected, for the 'ruddered' thing is 'ruddered' in virtue of its
               rudder. So it is in</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">all other cases. A head will be more accurately defined as the
               correlative of that</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">which is 'headed', than as that of an animal, for the animal
               does</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">not have a head qua animal, since many animals have no</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">head. Thus we may perhaps most easily comprehend that to which a
               thing is related,</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">when a name does not exist, if, from that which has a name, we
               derive</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">a new name, and apply it to that with which the first is
               reciprocally connected,</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">as in the aforesaid instances, when we derived the word 'winged'
               from 'wing' and from</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">'rudder'. All relatives, then, if properly defined, have a
               correlative. I add this condition</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">because, if that to which they are related is stated</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">as haphazard and not accurately, the two are not found to be
               interdependent. Let me</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">state what I mean more clearly. Even in the case</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">of acknowledged correlatives, and where names exist for each, there
               will</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">be no interdependence if one of the two is denoted, not</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">by that name which expresses the correlative notion, but by</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">one of irrelevant significance. The term 'slave,' if defined as
               related, not to a master,</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">but to a man, or a biped, or anything of that sort, is not
               reciprocally</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">connected with that in relation to which it is defined, for the
               statement is not exact.</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">Further, if one thing is said to be correlative with</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">another, and the terminology used is correct, then, though all
               irrelevant attributes should be removed,</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">and only that one attribute left in virtue of which it was
               correctly stated to</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">be correlative with that other, the stated correlation will still
               exist. If the correlative of</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">'the slave' is said to be 'the master', then, though all</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">irrelevant attributes of the said 'master', such as 'biped',
               'receptive</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">of knowledge', 'human', should be removed, and the attribute
               'master'</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">alone left, the stated correlation existing between him and the
               slave</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">will remain the same, for it is of a master that a slave is</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">said to be the slave. On the other hand, if, of two correlatives,
               one is</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">not correctly termed, then, when all other attributes are
               removed</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">and that alone is left in virtue of which it was</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">stated to be correlative, the stated correlation will be</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">found to have disappeared. For suppose the correlative of 'the
               slave' should be said</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">to be 'the man', or the correlative of 'the wing"the bird'; if the
               attribute</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">'master' be withdrawn from' the man', the correlation between 'the
               man' and 'the</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">slave' will cease to exist, for if the man is not a master, the
               slave</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">is not a slave. Similarly, if the attribute 'winged' be withdrawn
               from 'the bird',</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">'the wing' will no longer be relative; for if the so-called
               correlative is not winged,</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">it follows that 'the wing' has no correlative. Thus it is essential
               that the correlated</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">terms should be exactly designated; if there is a name</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">existing, the statement will be easy; if not, it is doubtless</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">our duty to construct names. When the terminology is thus correct,
               it is evident that all correlatives</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">are interdependent. Correlatives are thought to come into existence
               simultaneously. This is for the most</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">part true, as in the case of the double and the half. The existence
               of</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">the half necessitates the existence of that of which it is a half.
               Similarly the</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">existence of a master necessitates the existence of a slave, and
               that of a slave</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">implies that of a master; these are merely instances of a general
               rule. Moreover, they</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">cancel one another; for if there is no double it follows that there
               is</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">no half,</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">and vice versa; this rule also applies to all such
               correlatives.</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">Yet it does not appear to be true in all</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">cases that correlatives come into existence simultaneously. The
               object of knowledge would appear to exist</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">before knowledge itself, for it is usually the case that we acquire
               knowledge of</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">objects already existing; it would be difficult, if not
               impossible,</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">to find a branch of knowledge the beginning of the existence</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">of which was contemporaneous with that of its object.</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">Again, while the object of knowledge, if it ceases to exist,</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">cancels at the same time the knowledge which was its</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">correlative, the converse of this is not true. It is true that if
               the object</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">of knowledge does not exist there can be no knowledge: for there
               will no</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">longer be anything to know. Yet it is equally true that, if
               knowledge of a certain</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">object does not exist, the object may nevertheless quite well
               exist. Thus, in the case</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">of the squaring of the circle, if indeed that process is an object
               of knowledge,</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">though it itself exists as an object of knowledge, yet the
               knowledge of it has not</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">yet come into existence. Again, if all animals ceased to exist,
               there would be no</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">knowledge, but there might yet be many objects of knowledge. This
               is likewise the case</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">with regard to perception: for the object of perception is, it
               appears, prior to the act</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">of perception. If the perceptible is annihilated, perception also
               will cease to exist; but the</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">annihilation of perception does not cancel the existence of the
               perceptible. For perception implies a body</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">perceived and a body in which perception takes place. Now if that
               which is perceptible</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">is annihilated, it follows that the body is annihilated, for
               the</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">body is a perceptible thing; and if the body does not exist, it
               follows that</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">perception also ceases to exist. Thus the annihilation of the
               perceptible involves that of perception. But</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">the annihilation of perception does not involve that of the
               perceptible. For if the animal</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="8">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">is annihilated, it follows that perception also is annihilated,
               but</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">perceptibles such as body, heat, sweetness, bitterness, and so
               on,</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">will remain. Again, perception is generated at the same time
               as</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">the perceiving subject, for it comes into existence at the same time
               as the</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">animal. But the perceptible surely exists before perception; for
               fire and water and such elements,</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">out of which the animal is itself composed, exist before</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">the animal is an animal at all, and before perception. Thus</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">it would seem that the perceptible exists before perception. It
               may</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">be questioned whether it is true that no substance is
               relative,</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">as seems to be the case, or whether exception is to be made in
               the</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">case of certain secondary substances. With regard to primary
               substances, it is quite true that there</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">is no such</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">possibility, for neither wholes nor parts of primary substances
               are</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">relative. The individual man or ox is not defined with</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">reference to something external. Similarly with the parts: a
               particular hand or head is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">defined as a particular hand or head of a particular person, but as
               the hand or</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">head of a particular person. It is true also, for the</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">most part at least, in the case of secondary substances;</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">the species 'man' and the species 'ox' are not defined with
               reference to anything outside</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">themselves. Wood, again, is only relative in so far as</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">it is some one's property, not in so far as it</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">is wood. It is plain, then, that in the cases mentioned substance
               is not relative.</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">But with regard to some secondary substances there is a difference
               of opinion; thus, such terms</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">as 'head' and 'hand' are defined with reference to that of which
               the things indicated</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">are a part, and so it comes about that these appear to have a
               relative</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">character. Indeed, if our definition of that which is relative
               was</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">complete, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">that no substance is relative. If, however, our definition was
               not</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">complete, if those things only are properly called relative in the
               case of which relation to</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">an external object is a necessary condition of existence, perhaps
               some</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">explanation of the dilemma may be found. The former definition does
               indeed apply to all relatives,</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">but the fact that a thing is explained with reference to</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">something else does not make it essentially relative. From this it
               is plain that, if</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">a man definitely apprehends a relative thing, he will also
               definitely</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">apprehend that to which it is relative. Indeed this is
               self-evident:</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">for if a man knows that some particular thing is relative, assuming
               that we call that</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">a relative in the case of which relation to something</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">is a necessary condition of existence, he knows that also to which
               it is related.</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">For if he does not know at all that to which it is related, he
               will</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">not know whether or not it is relative. This is clear,</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">moreover, in particular instances. If a man knows definitely
               that</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">such and such a thing is 'double', he will also forthwith know
               definitely that of</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">which it is the double. For if there is nothing definite of which he
               knows it</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">to be the double, he does not know at all that it is double.
               Again,</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">if he knows that a thing is more beautiful, it follows necessarily
               that he will</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">forthwith definitely know that also than which it is more beautiful.
               He will not merely know</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">indefinitely that it is more beautiful than something which is less
               beautiful, for this</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">would be supposition, not knowledge. For if he does not know
               definitely that than which</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">it is more beautiful, he can no longer claim to know definitely
               that it is more</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">beautiful than something else which is less beautiful: for it might
               be that nothing was less</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">beautiful. It is, therefore, evident that if a man apprehends some
               relative thing definitely, he</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">necessarily knows that also definitely to which it is related. Now
               the head, the hand, and</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">such things are substances, and it is possible to know</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">their essential character definitely, but it does not necessarily
               follow</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">that we should know that to which they are related. It is not
               possible to know</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">forthwith whose head or hand is meant. Thus these are not
               relatives, and, this being</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">the case, it would be true to say that no substance</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">is relative in character. It is perhaps a difficult matter, in such
               cases, to make a</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">positive statement without more exhaustive examination, but to have
               raised</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">questions with regard to details is not without advantage. Part
               8</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">By 'quality' I mean that in virtue of which people</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">are said to be such and such. Quality is a term</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">that is used</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">in many senses. One sort of quality let us call</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">'habit' or 'disposition'. Habit differs from disposition in being
               more</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">lasting and more firmly established. The various kinds of knowledge
               and of virtue are habits,</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">for knowledge, even when acquired only in a moderate degree, is, it
               is agreed, abiding in</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">its character and difficult to displace, unless some great mental
               upheaval takes place, through disease</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">or any such cause. The virtues, also, such as justice,
               self-restraint, and so on, are</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">not easily dislodged or dismissed, so as to give place</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">to vice. By a disposition, on the other hand, we mean</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">a condition that is easily changed and quickly gives place to</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">its opposite. Thus, heat, cold, disease, health, and so on are
               dispositions. For a man</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">is disposed in one way or another with reference to these, but
               quickly changes, becoming cold</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">instead of warm, ill instead of well. So it is</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">with all other dispositions also, unless through lapse of
               time</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">a disposition has itself become inveterate and almost impossible
               to</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">dislodge: in which case we should perhaps go so far as to call it
               a</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="9">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">habit. It is evident that men incline to call those conditions
               habits which are of</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">a more or less permanent type and difficult to displace; for those
               who are</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">not retentive of knowledge, but volatile, are not said to have</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">such and such a 'habit' as regards knowledge, yet they are</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">disposed, we may say, either better or worse, towards knowledge.
               Thus habit differs from disposition in</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">this, that while the latter in ephemeral, the former is
               permanent</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">and difficult to alter. Habits are at the same time
               dispositions,</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">but dispositions are not necessarily habits. For those who have some
               specific habit may be</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">said also, in virtue of that habit, to be thus or</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">thus disposed; but those who are disposed in some specific way have
               not in all cases</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">the corresponding habit. Another sort of quality is that in virtue
               of which, for example,</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">we call men good boxers or runners, or healthy or sickly:</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">in fact it includes all</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">those terms which refer to inborn capacity or incapacity. Such
               things are not predicated</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">of a person in virtue of his disposition, but in virtue of his
               inborn</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">capacity or incapacity to do something with ease or to</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">avoid defeat of any kind. Persons are called good boxers</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">or good runners, not in virtue of such and</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">such a disposition, but in virtue of an inborn capacity</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">to accomplish something with ease. Men are called healthy in
               virtue</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">of the inborn capacity of easy resistance to those unhealthy</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">influences that may ordinarily arise; unhealthy, in virtue of the
               lack of this capacity. Similarly</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">with regard to softness and hardness. Hardness is predicated of a
               thing because</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">it has that capacity of resistance which enables it to withstand
               disintegration; softness, again, is</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">predicated of a thing by reason of the lack of that capacity. A
               third class</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">within this category is that of affective qualities and
               affections.</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">Sweetness, bitterness, sourness, are examples</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">of this sort of quality, together with all that is</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">akin to these; heat, moreover, and cold, whiteness, and blackness
               are affective qualities. It is</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">evident that these are qualities, for those things that possess
               them are themselves said to be</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">such and such by reason of their presence. Honey is called sweet
               because it</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">contains sweetness; the body is called white because it contains
               whiteness; and so in all</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">other cases. The term 'affective quality' is not used as indicating
               that those things</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">which admit these qualities are affected in any way. Honey is not
               called sweet because</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">it is affected in a specific way, nor is this what is meant
               in</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">any other instance. Similarly heat and cold are called affective
               qualities, not because those</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">things which admit them are affected. What is meant is that</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">these said qualities are capable of producing an 'affection' in the
               way of perception. For sweetness</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">has the power of affecting the sense of taste; heat,</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">that of touch; and so it is with the</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">rest of these qualities. Whiteness and blackness, however, and the
               other</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">colours, are not said to be affective qualities in this sense, but
               -because they themselves</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">are the results of an affection. It is plain that many changes of
               colour take</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">place because of affections. When a man is ashamed, he
               blushes;</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">when he is afraid, he becomes pale, and so on.</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">So true is this, that when a man is by nature liable to such
               affections,</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">arising from some concomitance of elements in his constitution, it
               is</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">a probable inference that he has the corresponding complexion of
               skin. For the same disposition</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">of bodily elements, which in the former instance was momentarily
               present in the case of</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">an access of shame, might be a result of a</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">man's natural temperament, so as to produce the corresponding
               colouring</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">also as a natural characteristic. All conditions, therefore, of
               this kind, if caused by certain</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">permanent and lasting affections, are called affective qualities.
               For pallor and duskiness of complexion</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">are called qualities, inasmuch as we are said to be such and such
               in virtue</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">of them, not only if they originate in natural constitution, but
               also if they come</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">about through long disease or sunburn, and are difficult to remove,
               or indeed remain</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">throughout life. For in the same way we are said to be such
               and</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">such because of these. Those conditions, however, which arise</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">from causes which may easily be rendered ineffective or speedily
               removed, are called, not qualities,</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">but affections: for we are not said to be such virtue of them. The
               man</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">who blushes through shame is not said to be a constitutional
               blusher, nor is</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">the man who becomes pale through fear said to be constitutionally
               pale. He is said</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">rather to have been affected. Thus such conditions are called
               affections, not qualities. In like</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">manner there are affective qualities and affections of the
               soul.</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">That temper with which a man is born and which has</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">its origin in certain deep-seated affections is called a
               quality.</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">I mean such conditions as insanity, irascibility, and so</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">on: for people are said to be mad or irascible in</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">virtue of these. Similarly those abnormal psychic states which
               are</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">not inborn, but arise from the concomitance of certain other
               elements, and are difficult</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">to remove, or altogether permanent, are called qualities, for in
               virtue of them men</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">are said to be such and such. Those, however, which arise from
               causes easily rendered</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="10">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">ineffective are called affections, not qualities. Suppose that a man
               is irritable when vexed: he</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">is not even spoken of as a bad-tempered man, when in such
               circumstances he loses</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">his temper somewhat, but rather is said to be affected. Such</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">conditions are therefore termed, not qualities, but affections. The
               fourth</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">sort of quality is figure and the shape that belongs to</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">a thing; and besides this, straightness and curvedness and any</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">other qualities of this type; each of these defines a</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">thing as being such and such. Because it is triangular or
               quadrangular a thing is</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">said to have a specific character, or again because it is straight
               or curved; in</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">fact a thing's</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">shape in every case gives rise to a qualification of</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">it. Rarity and density, roughness and smoothness, seem to be</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">terms indicating quality: yet these, it would appear, really belong
               to a class different from</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">that of quality. For it is rather a certain relative position of
               the parts composing</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">the thing thus qualified which, it appears, is indicated by each of
               these terms. A thing</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">is dense, owing to the fact that its parts are</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">closely combined with one another; rare, because there are
               interstices between</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">the parts; smooth, because its parts lie, so to speak,</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">evenly; rough, because some parts project beyond others. There may
               be other sorts of quality, but</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">those that are most properly so called have, we may safely</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">say, been enumerated. These, then, are qualities, and the things
               that take their name from</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">them as derivatives, or are in some other way dependent on</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">them, are said to be qualified in some specific way. In most,
               indeed in almost</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">all cases, the name of that which is qualified is derived from that
               of the quality.</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">Thus the terms 'whiteness', 'grammar', 'justice', give us the
               adjectives</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">'white', 'grammatical', 'just', and so on. There are some
               cases,</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">however, in which, as the quality under consideration has no</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">name, it is impossible that those possessed of it should have a
               name that is</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">derivative. For instance, the name given to the runner or boxer,
               who is so called</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">in virtue of an inborn capacity, is not derived from that of any
               quality; for lob</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">those capacities have no name assigned to them. In this, the inborn
               capacity is distinct</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">from the science, with reference to which men are called, e.g.
               boxers or wrestlers. Such</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">a science is classed as a disposition; it has a name, and is called
               'boxing'</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">or 'wrestling' as the case may be, and the name given to those
               disposed in</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">this way is derived from that of the science. Sometimes, even</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">though a name exists for the quality, that which takes its character
               from the quality has</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">a name that is not a derivative. For instance, the upright man takes
               his character from</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">the possession of the quality of integrity, but the name given him
               is not derived</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">from the word 'integrity'. Yet this does not occur often. We may
               therefore state that</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">those things are said to be possessed of some specific quality</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">which have a name derived from that of the aforesaid quality, or
               which are in</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">some other way dependent on it. One quality may be the</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">contrary of another; thus justice is the contrary of injustice,
               whiteness of blackness, and so</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">on. The things, also, which are said to be such and such in virtue
               of these</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">qualities, may be contrary the</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">one to the other; for that which is unjust is</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">contrary to that which is just, that which is white to</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">that which is black. This, however, is not always the</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">case. Red, yellow, and such colours, though qualities, have no
               contraries. If one of two</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">contraries is a quality, the other will also be a quality. This
               will be evident</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">from particular instances, if we apply the names used to denote the
               other categories; for</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">instance, granted that justice is the contrary of injustice and
               justice is a quality, injustice will</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">also be a quality: neither quantity, nor relation, nor place, nor
               indeed any other category but that</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">of quality, will be applicable properly to injustice. So it is with
               all other contraries</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">falling under the category of quality. Qualities admit of variation
               of degree. Whiteness is</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">predicated of one thing in a greater or less degree than of
               another. This</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">is also the case with reference to justice. Moreover, one and the
               same thing may exhibit</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">a quality in a greater degree than it did</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">before:</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">if a thing is white, it may become whiter. Though</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">this is generally the case, there are exceptions. For if we</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">should say that justice admitted of variation of degree,
               difficulties might ensue, and this is</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">true with regard to all those qualities which are dispositions.
               There are some, indeed, who dispute</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">the possibility of variation here. They maintain that justice and
               health</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">cannot very well admit of variation of degree themselves, but</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">that people vary in the degree in which they possess these</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">qualities, and that this is the case with grammatical
               learning</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">and all those qualities which are classed as dispositions. However
               that</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">may be, it is an incontrovertible fact that the things which in
               virtue of these qualities</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="11">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">are said to be what they are vary in the degree in which they
               possess them;</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">for one man is said to be better versed in grammar, or more healthy
               or just,</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">than another, and so on. The qualities expressed by the terms
               'triangular' and 'quadrangular'</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">do not appear to admit of variation of degree, nor indeed do any
               that have</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">to do with figure. For those things to which the definition of the
               triangle or</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">circle is applicable are all equally triangular or circular. Those,
               on the other hand, to</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">which the same definition is not applicable, cannot be said to
               differ from one another</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">in degree; the square is no more a circle than the rectangle, for to
               neither</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">is the definition of the circle appropriate. In short, if the
               definition of the term</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">proposed is not applicable to both objects, they cannot be
               compared. Thus it is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">all qualities which admit of variation of degree. Whereas none of
               the characteristics I have mentioned are</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">peculiar to quality, the fact that likeness and unlikeness
               can</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">be predicated with reference to quality only, gives to that
               category its distinctive feature. One thing</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">is like another only with reference to that in virtue of which it
               is such</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">and such; thus this forms the peculiar mark of quality. We</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">must not be disturbed because it may be argued that, though</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">proposing to discuss the category of quality, we have included in
               it many relative terms.</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">We did say that habits and dispositions were relative. In
               practically all such cases the</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">genus is relative, the</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">individual not. Thus knowledge, as a genus, is explained by</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">reference to something else, for we mean a knowledge of</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">something. But particular branches of knowledge are not thus
               explained. The knowledge of grammar is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">relative to anything external, nor is the knowledge of music,</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">but these, if relative at all, are relative only in virtue of their
               genera; thus grammar</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">is said be the knowledge of something, not the grammar of
               something; similarly music is</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">the knowledge of something, not the music of something. Thus
               individual branches of knowledge are not</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">relative. And it is because we possess these individual branches of
               knowledge that we are</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">said to be such and such. It is these that we</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">actually possess: we are called experts because we possess
               knowledge in some particular branch.</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">Those particular branches, therefore, of knowledge, in virtue of
               which we are sometimes said</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">to be such and such, are themselves qualities, and are not</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">relative. Further, if anything should happen to fall within both
               the</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">category of quality and that of relation, there would be nothing
               extraordinary in classing it</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">under both these heads.
               ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SECTION 3 Part
               9 Action and affection both admit of</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">contraries and also of variation of degree. Heating is the
               contrary</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">of cooling, being heated of being cooled, being glad of being
               vexed. Thus they admit of</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">contraries. They also admit of variation of degree: for it is
               possible to heat in</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">a greater or less degree; also to be heated in</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">a greater or less degree. Thus action and affection also
               admit</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">of variation of degree. So much, then, is stated</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">with regard to these categories. We spoke, moreover, of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">category of position when we were dealing with that of
               relation,</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">and stated that such terms derived their names from those of the
               corresponding attitudes. As for</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">the rest, time, place, state, since they are easily intelligible, I
               say no more about</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">them than was said at the beginning, that in the category of state
               are included such</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">states as 'shod', 'armed', in that of place 'in the Lyceum'</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">and so on, as was</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">explained before. Part 10 The proposed categories have,</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">then, been adequately dealt with. We must next explain the various
               senses in which the term 'opposite' is</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">used. Things are said to be opposed in four senses: (i) as
               correlatives to one another, (ii) as contraries</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">to one another, (iii) as privatives to positives, (iv) as
               affirmatives to negatives. Let me sketch my meaning</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">in outline. An instance of the use of the word 'opposite' with
               reference to correlatives is afforded by</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">the expressions 'double' and 'half'; with reference to contraries
               by 'bad' and 'good'. Opposites in the sense of</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">'privatives' and 'positives' are' blindness' and 'sight'; in the
               sense of affirmatives and negatives, the propositions 'he sits',</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">'he does not sit'. (i) Pairs of opposites which fall under the
               category of relation are explained by</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">a reference of the one to the other, the</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">reference being indicated by the preposition 'of' or by some other
               preposition. Thus, double is</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">a relative term, for that which is double is explained as</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">the double of something. Knowledge, again, is the opposite of the
               thing known, in the same</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">sense; and the thing known also is explained by its relation to its
               opposite, knowledge.</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">For the thing known is explained as that which is known</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">by something, that is, by knowledge. Such things, then, as</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">are opposite the one to the other in the sense of</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">being correlatives are explained by a reference of the one</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">to the other. (ii) Pairs of opposites which are contraries
               are</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">not in any way interdependent, but are contrary the one</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">to the other. The good is not spoken of as the</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">good of the had, but as the contrary of the bad, nor is white
               spoken</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">of as the white of the black, but as the contrary of the black.
               These two</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">types of opposition are therefore distinct.</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">Those contraries which are such that the subjects in which they are
               naturally present, or</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">of which they are predicated, must necessarily contain either the
               one or the other of</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">them, have no intermediate, but those in the case of which no such
               necessity obtains,</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">always have an intermediate. Thus disease and health are naturally
               present in the body of</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">an animal, and it is necessary that either the one or the other
               should be present</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">in the body of an animal. Odd and even, again, are predicated of
               number, and</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">it is necessary that the one or the other should be present in
               numbers. Now there</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="12">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">is no intermediate between the terms of either of these two pairs.
               On the other</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">hand, in those contraries with regard to which no such necessity
               obtains, we find an intermediate.</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">Blackness and whiteness are naturally present in the body, but it is
               not necessary that either</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">the one or the other should be present in the</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">body, inasmuch as it is not true to say that everybody must be white
               or black.</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">Badness and goodness, again, are predicated of man, and of many
               other things, but it</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">is not necessary that either the one quality or the other should be
               present in</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">that of which they are predicated: it is not true to say that
               everything that may</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">be good or bad must be either good or bad. These pairs of contraries
               have intermediates:</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">the intermediates between white and black are grey, sallow, and all
               the other colours that</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">come between; the intermediate between good and bad is that which
               is neither the one nor</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">the other. Some intermediate qualities have names, such as grey and
               sallow and all the</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">other colours that come between white and black; in other cases,
               however, it is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">easy to name the intermediate, but we must define it as</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">that which is not either extreme, as in the case of</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">that which is neither good nor bad, neither just nor unjust. (iii)
               'privatives' and 'Positives'</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">have reference to the same subject. Thus, sight and blindness have
               reference to the eye. It</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">is a universal rule that each of a pair of opposites</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">of this type has reference to that to which the particular
               'positive' is natural. We say</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">that that is capable of some particular faculty or possession has
               suffered privation when the faculty</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">or possession in question is in no way present in that in which,
               and at</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">the time at which, it should naturally be present. We do</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">not call that toothless which has not teeth, or that</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">blind which has not sight, but rather that which has</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">not teeth</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">or sight at the time when by nature it should.</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">For there are some creatures which from birth are without sight, or
               without teeth, but these</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">are not called toothless or blind. To be without some faculty or to
               possess it</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">is not the same as the corresponding 'privative' or 'positive'.
               'Sight' is a 'positive', 'blindness'</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">a 'privative', but 'to possess sight' is not equivalent to
               'sight',</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">'to be blind' is not equivalent to 'blindness'. Blindness is</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">a 'privative', to be blind is to be in a state of privation, but
               is</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">not a 'privative'. Moreover, if 'blindness' were equivalent to
               'being blind',</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">both would be predicated of the same subject; but though</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">a man is said to be blind, he is by no means said to be blindness.
               To</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">be in a state of 'possession' is, it appears, the opposite of being
               in a</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">state of 'privation', just as 'positives' and 'privatives'
               themselves are opposite. There is the same</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">type of antithesis in both cases; for just as blindness is opposed
               to sight, so is</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">being blind opposed to having sight. That which is affirmed or
               denied is not itself affirmation</div>
            <div type="l" n="40">or denial. By 'affirmation' we mean an affirmative proposition,
               by</div>
            <div type="l" n="41">'denial' a negative. Now, those facts which form the matter of the
               affirmation or denial</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">are not propositions; yet these two are said to be opposed</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">in the same sense as the affirmation and denial, for in this case
               also the type</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">of antithesis is the same. For as the affirmation is opposed to the
               denial, as</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">in the two propositions 'he sits', 'he does not sit', so also the
               fact which</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">constitutes the matter of the proposition in one case is opposed to
               that in the other,</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">his sitting, that is to say, to his not sitting. It is evident that
               'positives' and</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">'privatives' are not opposed each to each in the same sense as
               relatives. The</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">one is not explained by reference to the other; sight is not sight
               of</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">blindness, nor is any other preposition used to indicate the
               relation. Similarly blindness is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">said to be blindness of sight, but rather, privation of sight.
               Relatives, moreover, reciprocate; if</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">blindness, therefore, were a relative, there would be a
               reciprocity</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">of relation between it and that with which it was
               correlative.</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">But this is not the case. Sight is not called the</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">sight of blindness. That those terms which fall under the heads of
               'positives' and 'privatives' are</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">not opposed each to each as contraries, either, is plain from the
               following facts: Of a</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">pair of contraries such that they have no intermediate, one or the
               other must needs</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">be present in the subject in which they naturally subsist, or</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">of which they are predicated; for it is those, as</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">we proved,' in the case of which this necessity obtains, that</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">have no intermediate. Moreover, we cited health and disease, odd
               and even, as instances. But</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">those contraries which have an intermediate are not subject to any
               such necessity. It is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">necessary that every substance, receptive of such qualities, should
               be either</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">black or white,</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">cold or hot, for something intermediate between these contraries
               may very well be present</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">in the subject. We proved, moreover, that those contraries have an
               intermediate in the case</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">of which the said necessity does not obtain. Yet when one of the
               two contraries</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">is a constitutive property of the subject, as it is a constitutive
               property of fire to</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">be hot, of snow to be white, it is necessary determinately that one
               of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">two contraries, not one or the other, should be present in the
               subject; for fire cannot</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">be cold, or snow black. Thus, it is not the case here that one of
               the</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">two must needs be present in every subject receptive of</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">these qualities, but only in that subject of which the one</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">forms a constitutive property. Moreover, in such cases it is one
               member of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">pair determinately, and not either the one or the other, which must
               be present. In</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', on the other hand,</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">neither of the aforesaid statements holds good. For it is</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">not necessary that a subject receptive of the qualities should
               always</div>
            <div type="l" n="40">have either the one or the other; that which has not</div>
            <div type="l" n="41">yet advanced to the state when sight is natural is not said
               either</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="13">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">to be blind or to see. Thus 'positives' and 'privatives' do not
               belong to that</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">class of contraries which consists of those which have no
               intermediate. On the other hand,</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">they do not belong either to that class which consists of contraries
               which have an intermediate.</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">For under certain conditions it is necessary that either the one or
               the other should</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">form part of the constitution of every appropriate subject. For when
               a thing has</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">reached the stage when it is by nature capable of sight, it will be
               said either</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">to see or to be blind, and that in an indeterminate sense,
               signifying that the capacity</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">may be either present or absent; for it is not necessary either that
               it should</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">see or that it should be blind, but that it</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">should be either in the one state or in the other. Yet in the case
               of</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">those contraries which have an intermediate we found that it was
               never necessary that either</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">the one or the other should be present in every appropriate
               subject, but only that</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">in certain subjects one of the pair should be present, and that in
               a determinate sense. It</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">is, therefore, plain that 'positives' and 'privatives' are not
               opposed each to each in either</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">of the senses in which contraries are opposed. Again, in the case
               of contraries, it is</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">possible that there should be changes from either into the other,
               while the subject retains its</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">identity, unless indeed one of the contraries is a constitutive
               property of that subject, as</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">heat is of fire. For it is possible that that that</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">which is healthy should become diseased, that which is white,
               black, that which is cold, hot, that</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">which is good, bad, that which is bad, good. The bad man, if he
               is</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">being brought into a better way of life and thought, may make some
               advance, however</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">slight, and if he should once improve, even ever so little, it is
               plain that he</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">might change completely, or at any rate make very great progress;
               for a man becomes</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">more and more easily moved to virtue, however small the improvement
               was at first. It</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">is, therefore, natural to suppose that he will make yet greater
               progress than he has made</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">in the past; and as this process goes on, it will change him
               completely and establish</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">him in the contrary state, provided he is not hindered by lack of
               time. In</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', however, change in both
               directions is impossible. There may</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">be a change from possession to privation, but not from privation to
               possession. The man who</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">has become blind does not regain his sight; the man who has become
               bald does</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">not regain his hair; the man who has lost his teeth does not grow
               his</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">grow a new set. (iv) Statements opposed as affirmation and negation
               belong manifestly to a</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">class which is distinct, for in this case, and in this case only,
               it is</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">necessary for the one opposite to be true and the other false.
               Neither in the</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">case of contraries, nor in</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">the case of correlatives, nor in the case of 'positives' and
               'privatives', is</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">it necessary for one to be true and the other false.</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">Health and disease are contraries: neither of them is true or</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">false. 'Double' and 'half' are opposed to each other as
               correlatives:</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">neither of them is true or false. The case is the same, of course,
               with regard</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">to 'positives' and 'privatives' such as 'sight' and 'blindness'. In
               short,</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">where there is no sort of combination of words, truth and falsity
               have no place, and</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">all the opposites we have mentioned so far consist of simple words.
               At the same time,</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">when the words which enter into opposed statements are contraries,
               these, more than any other set of</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">opposites, would seem to claim this characteristic. 'Socrates is
               ill' is the contrary of 'Socrates</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">is well', but not even of such composite expressions is it true to
               say that</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">one of the pair must always be true and the other false. For if
               Socrates</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">exists, one will be true and the other false, but if he does
               not</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">exist, both will be false; for neither 'Socrates is ill' nor
               'Socrates is well' is true,</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">if Socrates does not exist at all. In the case of 'positives' and
               'privatives', if</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">the subject does not exist at all, neither proposition is true, but
               even if the subject</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">exists, it is not always the fact that one is true and the other
               false.</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">For 'Socrates has sight' is the opposite of 'Socrates is blind' in
               the sense of</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">the word 'opposite' which applies to possession and privation. Now
               if</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">Socrates exists, it is not necessary that one should be</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">true and the other false, for when he is not</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">yet able to acquire the power of vision, both are</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">false, as also if Socrates is altogether non-existent. But in the
               case of affirmation and</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">negation, whether the subject exists or not, one is always false
               and the other</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">true. For manifestly, if Socrates exists, one of the two
               propositions 'Socrates is ill',</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">'Socrates is not ill', is true, and the other false. This</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">is likewise the case if he does not exist; for</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">if he does not exist, to say that he is ill</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">is false, to say that he is not ill is true. Thus it is in</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">the case of those opposites only, which are opposite in the sense
               in which the</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">term is used with reference to affirmation and negation, that the
               rule holds good, that one</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">of the pair must be true and the other false.</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">Part 11 That the contrary of a good is an evil is shown by
               induction:</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">the contrary of health is disease, of courage, cowardice, and so
               on. But the contrary of</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">an evil is sometimes a good, sometimes an evil. For defect, which
               is an</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">evil, has excess for</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">its contrary, this also being an evil, and the mean. which is a
               good, is</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">equally the contrary of the one and of the other. It is only in a
               few</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="14">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">cases, however, that we see instances of this: in most, the contrary
               of an evil is a</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">good. In the case of contraries, it is not always necessary that if
               one exists the</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">other should also exist: for if all become healthy there will</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">be health and no disease, and again, if everything turns
               white,</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">there will be white, but no black. Again, since the fact that
               Socrates is ill</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">is the contrary of the fact that Socrates is well, and two contrary
               conditions cannot both</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">obtain in one and the same individual at the same time, both these
               contraries could not exist</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">at once: for if that Socrates was well was a fact, then that
               Socrates was</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">ill could not possibly be one. It is plain that contrary attributes
               must needs be</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">present in subjects which belong to the same species or genus.
               Disease and health require as</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">their subject the body of an animal; white and black require</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">a body, without further qualification; justice and injustice
               require as their subject the human soul. Moreover,</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">it is necessary that pairs of contraries should in</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">all cases either belong to the same genus or belong to</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">contrary genera or be themselves genera. White and black belong to
               the same genus, colour; justice</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">and injustice, to contrary genera, virtue and vice; while good and
               evil do not belong to</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">genera, but are themselves actual genera, with terms under them.
               Part 12 There are four senses</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">in which one thing can be said to be 'prior' to another. Primarily
               and most properly</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">the term has reference to time: in this sense the word</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">is used to indicate that one thing is older or more</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">ancient than another, for the expressions 'older' and 'more
               ancient' imply greater length of time.</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">Secondly, one thing is said to be 'prior' to another when the
               sequence of their being</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">cannot be</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">reversed. In this sense 'one' is 'prior' to 'two'. For if</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">'two' exists, it follows directly that 'one' must exist,</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">but if 'one' exists, it does not follow necessarily that 'two'
               exists: thus the sequence subsisting cannot</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">be reversed. It is agreed, then, that when the sequence of two
               things cannot be</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">reversed, then that one on which the other depends is called
               'prior' to that other. In</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">the third place, the term 'prior' is used with reference</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">to any order, as in the case of science and of oratory. For in
               sciences which</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">use demonstration there is that which is prior and that which is
               posterior in order; in</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">geometry, the elements are prior to the propositions; in reading
               and writing, the letters of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">alphabet are prior to the syllables. Similarly, in the case of
               speeches, the exordium is</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">prior in order to the narrative. Besides these senses of the word,
               there is a</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">fourth. That which is better and more honourable is said to have a
               natural priority. In common</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">parlance men speak of those whom they honour and love as 'coming
               first' with them.</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">This sense of the word is perhaps the most far-fetched. Such, then,
               are the different senses</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">in which the term 'prior' is used. Yet it would seem</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">that besides those mentioned there is yet another. For in
               those</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">things, the being of each of which implies that of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">other, that which is in any way the cause may</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">reasonably be said to be by nature 'prior' to the</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">effect. It is plain that there are instances of this. The</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">fact of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">being of a man carries with it the truth of</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">the proposition that he is, and the implication is reciprocal:
               for</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">if a man is, the proposition wherein we allege that he is true, and
               conversely,</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">if the proposition wherein we allege that he is true, then he is.
               The true proposition,</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">however, is in no way the cause of the being of the man, but
               the</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">fact of the man's being does seem somehow to be the cause of the
               truth of</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">the proposition, for the truth or falsity of the proposition
               depends on the fact of</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">the man's being or not being. Thus the word 'prior' may be used in
               five</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">senses. Part 13 The term 'simultaneous' is primarily and most
               appropriately applied to those things</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">the genesis of the one of which is simultaneous with that of the
               other; for in</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">such cases neither is prior or posterior to the other. Such things
               are said to</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">be simultaneous in point of time. Those things, again, are
               'simultaneous'</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">in point of nature, the being of each of</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">which involves that of the other, while at the same time neither is
               the cause of</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">the other's being.</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">This is the case with regard to the double</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">and the half, for these are reciprocally dependent, since, if</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">there is a double, there is also a half, and if</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">there is a half, there is also a double, while</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">at the same time neither is the cause of the being of the other.
               Again,</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">those species which are distinguished one from another and opposed
               one to another within the same genus</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">are said to be 'simultaneous' in nature. I mean those species which
               are distinguished each</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">from each by one and the same method of division. Thus the 'winged'
               species is</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">simultaneous with the 'terrestrial' and the 'water' species. These
               are distinguished within the same genus, and</div>
            <div type="l" n="34">are opposed each to each, for the genus 'animal' has the 'winged',
               the 'terrestrial',</div>
            <div type="l" n="35">and the 'water' species, and no one of these is prior or posterior
               to another; on</div>
            <div type="l" n="36">the contrary, all such things appear to be 'simultaneous' in</div>
            <div type="l" n="37">nature. Each of these also, the terrestrial, the winged, and the
               water species, can be divided again</div>
            <div type="l" n="38">into subspecies. Those species, then, also will be 'simultaneous'
               point of</div>
            <div type="l" n="39">nature, which, belonging to the same genus, are distinguished each
               from each by</div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="p" n="15">
         <div type="c" n="a">
            <div type="l" n="1">one and the same method of differentiation. But genera are prior to
               species, for the</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">sequence of their being cannot be reversed. If there is the species
               'water-animal', there will</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">be the genus 'animal', but granted the being of the genus 'animal',
               it does not follow</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">necessarily that there will be the species 'water-animal'. Those
               things, therefore, are said to be</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">'simultaneous' in nature, the being of each of which involves that
               of the other, while</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">at the same time neither is in any way the cause of the other's
               being; those species,</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">also, which are distinguished each from each and opposed within
               the</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">same genus. Those things, moreover, are 'simultaneous' in the
               unqualified sense of the word which</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">come into being at the same time. Part 14 There are six sorts of
               movement: generation, destruction,</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">increase, diminution, alteration, and change of place. It is
               evident in all but one case that</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">all these sorts</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">of movement are distinct each from each. Generation is
               distinct</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">from destruction, increase and change of place from diminution, and
               so on. But in the case</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">of alteration it may be argued that the process necessarily implies
               one or other of</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">the other five sorts of motion. This is not true, for we may say
               that all</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">affections, or nearly all, produce in us an alteration which is
               distinct from all other sorts</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">of motion, for that which is affected need not suffer either
               increase or diminution or any of</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">the other sorts of motion. Thus alteration is a distinct sort of
               motion; for, if it were</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">not, the thing altered would not only be altered, but would
               forthwith necessarily suffer increase</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">or diminution or some one of the other sorts of motion in addition;
               which as</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">a matter of fact is not the case. Similarly that</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">which was undergoing the process of increase or was subject
               to</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">some other sort of motion would, if alteration were not a</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">distinct form of motion, necessarily be subject to alteration also.
               But there are some things</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">which undergo increase but yet not alteration. The square, for
               instance,</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">if a gnomon is applied to it, undergoes increase but not
               alteration, and so</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">it is with all other figures of this sort. Alteration and increase,
               therefore, are distinct.</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">Speaking generally, rest is the contrary of motion. But the
               different forms of motion have</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">their own contraries in other forms; thus destruction is the
               contrary of generation, diminution of increase,</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">rest in a place, of change of place. As for this last, change in
               the</div>
            <div type="l" n="33">reverse direction would</div>
         </div>
         <div type="c" n="b">
            <div type="l" n="1">seem to be most truly its contrary; thus motion upwards</div>
            <div type="l" n="2">is the contrary of motion downwards and vice versa. In</div>
            <div type="l" n="3">the case of that sort of motion which yet remains,</div>
            <div type="l" n="4">of those that have been enumerated, it is not easy to</div>
            <div type="l" n="5">state what is its contrary. It appears to have no</div>
            <div type="l" n="6">contrary, unless one should define the contrary here also either
               as</div>
            <div type="l" n="7">'rest in its quality' or as 'change in the direction of the contrary
               quality', just as</div>
            <div type="l" n="8">we defined the contrary of change of place either as rest in a place
               or</div>
            <div type="l" n="9">as change in the reverse direction. For a thing is altered when
               change of quality takes place;</div>
            <div type="l" n="10">therefore either rest in its quality or change in the</div>
            <div type="l" n="11">direction of the contrary may be called the contrary of this
               qualitative form of motion.</div>
            <div type="l" n="12">In this way becoming white is the contrary of becoming black; there
               is alteration in</div>
            <div type="l" n="13">the contrary direction, since a change of a qualitative nature
               takes place. Part 15 The</div>
            <div type="l" n="14">term 'to have' is used in various senses. In the first place it is
               used with</div>
            <div type="l" n="15">reference to habit or disposition or any other quality, for we are
               said to 'have'</div>
            <div type="l" n="16">a piece of knowledge or a virtue.</div>
            <div type="l" n="17">Then, again, it has reference to quantity, as, for</div>
            <div type="l" n="18">instance, in the case of a man's height; for</div>
            <div type="l" n="19">he is said to 'have' a height of three or</div>
            <div type="l" n="20">four cubits. It is used, moreover, with regard to apparel, a man
               being said to</div>
            <div type="l" n="21">'have' a coat or tunic; or in respect of something which we have on
               a</div>
            <div type="l" n="22">part of ourselves, as a ring on the hand: or in respect of
               something</div>
            <div type="l" n="23">which is a part of us, as hand or foot. The term refers also to
               content,</div>
            <div type="l" n="24">as in the case of a vessel and wheat, or of a jar and wine; a</div>
            <div type="l" n="25">jar is said to 'have' wine, and a corn-measure wheat.</div>
            <div type="l" n="26">The expression in such cases has reference to content. Or</div>
            <div type="l" n="27">it refers to that which has been acquired; we are said</div>
            <div type="l" n="28">to 'have' a house or a field. A man is also said to 'have' a
               wife,</div>
            <div type="l" n="29">and a wife a husband, and this appears to be the most remote
               meaning of the</div>
            <div type="l" n="30">term, for by the use of it we mean simply that the husband lives
               with the</div>
            <div type="l" n="31">wife. Other senses of the word might perhaps be found, but the most
               ordinary ones</div>
            <div type="l" n="32">have all been enumerated.</div>
