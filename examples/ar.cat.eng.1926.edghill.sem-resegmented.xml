               <div type="ic" n="1"> SECTION 1 Part 1 Things are said to be named 'equivocally'
                  when, though they have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name
                  differs for each. Thus, a real man and a figure in a picture can both lay claim to
                  the name 'animal';</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">yet these are equivocally so named, for, though they have a
                  common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs for each.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">For should any one define in what sense each is an animal, his
                  definition in the one case will be appropriate to that case only.</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">On the other hand, things are said to be named 'univocally'
                  which have both the name and the definition answering to the name in common. A man
                  and an ox are both 'animal',</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">and these are univocally so named, inasmuch as not only the
                  name, but also the definition, is the same in both cases:</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">for if a man should state in what sense each is an animal, the
                  statement in the one case would be identical with that in the other.</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">Things are said to be named 'derivatively', which derive their
                  name from some other name, but differ from it in termination. Thus the grammarian
                  derives his name from the word 'grammar', and the courageous man from the word
                  'courage'.</div>

                  'the man wins';</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">of the former 'man', 'ox', 'runs', 'wins'.</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">Of things themselves some are predicable of a subject, and are
                  never present in a subject. Thus 'man' is predicable of the individual man, and is
                  never present in a subject.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts
                  are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said
                  subject. Some things, again, are present in a subject, but are never predicable of
                  a subject. For instance, a certain point of grammatical knowledge is present in
                  the mind, but is not predicable of any subject; or again, a certain whiteness may
                  be present in the body (for colour requires a material basis), yet it is never
                  predicable of anything.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">Other things, again, are both predicable of a subject and
                  present in a subject. Thus while knowledge is present in the human mind, it is
                  predicable of grammar.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">There is, lastly, a class of things which are neither present in
                  a subject nor predicable of a subject, such as the individual man or the
                  individual horse. But, to speak more generally, that which is individual and has
                  the character of a unit is never predicable of a subject.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">Yet in some cases there is nothing to prevent such being present
                  in a subject.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">Thus a certain point of grammatical knowledge is present in a
                  subject.</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">Part 3 When one thing is predicated of another, all that which
                  is predicable of the predicate will be predicable also of the subject. Thus, 'man'
                  is predicated of the individual man; but 'animal' is predicated of 'man'; it will,
                  therefore, be predicable of the individual man also: for the individual man is
                  both 'man' and 'animal'. If genera are different</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">and co-ordinate, their differentiae are themselves different in
                  kind. Take as an instance the genus 'animal' and the genus 'knowledge'.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">'With feet', 'two-footed', 'winged', 'aquatic', are differentiae
                  of 'animal'; the species of knowledge are not distinguished</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">by the same differentiae. One species of knowledge</div>

            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">does not differ from another in being 'two-footed'. But where
                  one genus is subordinate to another, there is nothing to prevent their having
                  the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">same differentiae: for the greater class is predicated of the
                  lesser, so that all the differentiae of the predicate will be differentiae also of

               <div type="ic" n="1">relation, place, time, position, state, action, or affection. To

                  long' or 'three cubits long', of quality, such attributes as 'white',

               <div type="ic" n="2">it is by the combination of</div>

               <div type="ic" n="5">admitted, be either true or false,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">whereas expressions which are not in</div>

               <div type="ic" n="8">'white', 'runs', 'wins', cannot be either true</div>
               <div type="ic" n="9">or false. Part 5 Substance, in</div>
               <div type="ic" n="10">the truest and primary and most definite</div>

            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">sense of the word, is that which is neither predicable of a
                  subject nor present in a subject; for instance, the individual man or horse. But
                  in a secondary sense those things are</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">called substances within which, as species, the primary
                  substances are included; also those which, as genera, include the species. For
                  instance, the individual man is included in the species 'man', and the genus to
                  which the species belongs is 'animal'; these, therefore-that</div>
            </div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="ch" n="5">
         <div type="par" n="1">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">is to say, the species 'man' and the genus 'animal,-are termed
                  secondary substances. It is plain from what has been said that both the name and
                  the definition of the predicate must be predicable of the subject. For instance,
                  'man' is</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">predicted of the individual man. Now in this case the name of
                  the species man' is applied to the individual, for we use the term 'man' in
                  describing</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">the individual; and the definition of 'man' will also be
                  predicated of the individual man, for the individual man is both</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">man and animal. Thus, both the name and the definition of the
                  species are predicable of the</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">individual. With regard, on the other hand, to those things
                  which are present in a subject, it is generally the case that neither their name
                  nor their definition is predicable of that in which</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">they are present. Though, however, the definition is never
                  predicable, there is nothing in certain cases to prevent the name being used. For
                  instance, 'white' being present in a body is predicated of that in which it</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">is present, for a body is called white: the definition, however,
                  of the colour white' is never predicable of the body. Everything except primary
                  substances is either predicable of a</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">primary substance or present in a primary substance. This
                  becomes evident by reference to particular instances which occur.</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">'Animal' is predicated of the species 'man', therefore of the
                  individual man, for if there were no individual man of whom it could be</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">predicated, it could not be predicated of the species 'man' at
                  all. Again, colour is present in body, therefore in individual bodies,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">for if there were no individual body in which it was present, it
                  could not be present in body at all. Thus everything except primary substances is
                  either predicated of primary substances, or is present in them, and if these</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">last did not exist, it would be impossible for anything else to
                  exist. Of secondary substances, the species is more truly substance than the</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="6">
               <div type="ic" n="1">genus, being more nearly related to primary substance. For
                  if</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">any one should render an account of what a primary substance is,
                  he would render a more instructive account, and one more proper to the subject, by
                  stating the species than by stating the genus. Thus, he</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">would give a more instructive account of an individual man by
                  stating that he was</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">man than by stating that he was animal, for the former
                  description is peculiar to</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">the individual in a greater degree, while the latter is too
                  general. Again, the man who gives an account of the nature of</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="7">
               <div type="ic" n="1">an individual tree will give a more instructive account by

                  modification occurs in the case of something else. The truth or falsity of a
                  statement depends on facts, and not on any power on the part of the statement
                  itself of admitting contrary qualities. In short, there is nothing which can alter
                  the nature of statements and opinions. As, then, no change takes place in
                  themselves, these cannot</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">be said to be capable of admitting contrary qualities. But it is
                  by reason of the modification which takes place within the substance itself that a
                  substance is</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">said to be capable of admitting contrary qualities; for a
                  substance admits within itself either disease or health, whiteness or blackness.
                  It is in this sense that</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">it is said to be capable</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">of admitting contrary qualities. To sum up, it is a distinctive
                  mark of substance, that, while remaining numerically one and the same, it is
                  capable of admitting contrary qualities, the modification taking place through a
                  change in the substance itself. Let these remarks suffice</div>

               <div type="ic" n="2">Part 6 Quantity is either discrete or continuous. Moreover, some
                  quantities are such that each part of the whole has a relative position to the

               <div type="ic" n="3">have within them no such relation of part to part. Instances of
                  discrete quantities are number and speech; of continuous, lines, surfaces, solids,
                  and, besides these, time and place. In the case of</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">the parts of a number, there is no common boundary at which they
                  join. For example: two fives make ten, but the two fives have no common boundary,
                  but are separate; the parts three</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">and seven also do not join at any boundary. Nor, to generalize,
                  would it ever be possible in the case</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">of number that there should be a common boundary among the
                  parts; they are always separate. Number, therefore, is a discrete quantity. The

                  abiding existence, and that which</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">does not abide can hardly have position. It would be better to
                  say that such parts had a relative order, in virtue of one being prior to another.
                  Similarly with number: in counting, 'one' is</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">prior to 'two', and 'two' to</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">'three', and thus the parts of number may be said to possess

            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">relative order, though it would be impossible to discover any

               <div type="ic" n="2">of its parts has an abiding existence: when once a syllable is
                  pronounced, it is not possible to retain it, so that, naturally, as the parts do
                  not abide, they cannot have position. Thus, some quantities consist of parts which
                  have position, and some of those which have not. Strictly speaking, only</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">the things which I have mentioned belong to the category of
                  quantity: everything else that is called quantitative is a quantity in a secondary
                  sense. It is because we have in mind some one</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">of these quantities, properly so called, that we apply
                  quantitative terms to other things.</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">We speak of what is white as large, because the surface over
                  which the white extends is large; we speak of an action or a process as lengthy,
                  because the time covered is long; these things cannot</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">in their own</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">right claim the quantitative epithet. For instance, should any
                  one explain how long an action was, his statement would be made in terms of the
                  time taken, to the effect that it lasted a year, or something of that sort. In the

            </div>
            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">would explain the size of a white object in terms of surface,
                  for he would state the area which it covered. Thus</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">the things already mentioned, and these alone, are in their
                  intrinsic nature quantities; nothing else</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">can claim the name in</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">its own right, but, if at all, only in a secondary sense.
                  Quantities have no contraries. In the case of definite quantities this is obvious;
                  thus, there is nothing that is the contrary of 'two cubits long'</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="6">
               <div type="ic" n="1">or of 'three cubits long', or of a surface, or of any such
                  quantities. A man might, indeed, argue</div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div type="par" n="3">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">that 'much' was the contrary of 'little', and 'great' of
                  'small'. But these are not quantitative, but relative; things are</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">not great or small absolutely, they are so called rather as the
                  result of an act of comparison. For instance, a mountain is called small, a grain
                  large, in virtue of the fact that the latter is greater than others of its
                  kind,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">the former less. Thus there is a reference here</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">to an external standard, for if the terms 'great' and 'small'
                  were used absolutely, a mountain would never be called small or a grain large.
                  Again, we say that there are many people in a village, and few in Athens, although
                  those in the city are many times as numerous as those in the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">village: or we say that a house has many in it, and a theatre
                  few, though those in the theatre far outnumber those in the house. The terms 'two
                  cubits long, "three</div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div type="par" n="4">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">cubits long,' and so on indicate quantity, the terms 'great' and
                  'small' indicate relation, for they have reference to an external standard. It is,
                  therefore, plain that these are to be classed as relative. Again, whether we
                  define them as quantitative or not, they have no contraries: for how can there be
                  a contrary of an attribute which is not to be apprehended</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">in or by itself, but only by reference</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">to something external? Again, if 'great' and 'small' are
                  contraries, it will come about that the same subject can admit contrary qualities
                  at one and the same time, and that things will themselves be contrary to
                  themselves. For it happens at times that the same thing</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">is both small and great. For the same thing may be small in
                  comparison with one thing, and great in comparison with another, so that the same
                  thing comes to be both small and</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">great at one and the same time, and is of such a nature as to
                  admit contrary qualities at one and the same moment. Yet it was agreed, when
                  substance was being discussed, that nothing admits contrary qualities at one and
                  the same</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">moment. For though substance is capable of admitting contrary
                  qualities, yet no one is at the same time both sick and healthy, nothing is at the
                  same time both white and black. Nor is</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">there anything which is qualified in contrary ways at</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">one and the same time. Moreover, if these</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">were contraries, they would themselves be contrary to
                  themselves. For if 'great' is the contrary of 'small', and the same thing</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">is both great and small at the same time, then 'small' or
                  'great' is the contrary of itself. But this is impossible. The term 'great',
                  therefore, is not the contrary of the term 'small', nor 'much' of 'little'. And
                  even though a man should call these terms not relative but quantitative, they
                  would not have contraries.</div>

            <div type="s" n="6">
               <div type="ic" n="1">It is in the case of space that quantity most plausibly appears
                  to admit of a contrary. For men define the term 'above' as the contrary of</div>

                  'below'; and this is so, because nothing is farther from the extremities of</div>

               <div type="ic" n="4">it seems that in defining contraries of every kind men have
                  recourse to a spatial metaphor, for they say that those things are contraries

               <div type="ic" n="3">the existence of the perceptible. For perception implies a body

            <div type="s" n="7">
               <div type="ic" n="1">follows that perception also ceases to exist. Thus the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">annihilation of the perceptible involves that of perception. But
                  the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">annihilation of perception does not involve that of the
                  perceptible. For if the animal is annihilated, it follows that perception also

                  time as the perceiving subject, for it comes into existence at the same time as
                  the animal. But the perceptible surely exists before perception; for fire and

                  Thus it would seem that the perceptible exists before perception. It may be

                  our definition of that which is relative was complete, it is very difficult, if
                  not impossible, to</div>

            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">prove that no substance is relative. If, however, our definition
                  was not complete, if those things only are properly called relative in the case of

               <div type="ic" n="2">relation to an external object is a necessary condition of
                  existence, perhaps some explanation of the dilemma may be found. The former
                  definition does indeed apply to all relatives, but the fact that a</div>

            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">thing is explained with reference to something else does not
                  make it essentially relative. From this it is plain that, if a man definitely
                  apprehends a relative thing, he will also definitely apprehend that to</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">which it is relative. Indeed this is self-evident: for if a man
                  knows that some particular thing is relative, assuming that we call that a

               <div type="ic" n="1">the case of which relation to something is a necessary condition

            <div type="s" n="7">
               <div type="ic" n="1">related, he will not know whether or not it is relative. This is
                  clear, moreover, in particular instances. If a man knows definitely that such

            <div type="s" n="8">
               <div type="ic" n="1">such a thing is 'double', he will</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">also forthwith know definitely that of which it is the double.
                  For if there is nothing definite of which he knows it to be the double, he does
                  not know at all that it is double.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">Again, if he knows that a thing is more beautiful, it follows
                  necessarily that he will forthwith definitely know</div>

            <div type="s" n="9">
               <div type="ic" n="1">that also than which it is more beautiful. He</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">will not merely know indefinitely that it is more beautiful than
                  something which is less beautiful, for this would be supposition, not knowledge.
                  For if he does not know definitely that than which it is more beautiful, he can no
                  longer claim to know definitely that it is more beautiful</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">than something else which is less beautiful: for it might be
                  that nothing was less beautiful. It is, therefore, evident that if a man
                  apprehends some relative thing definitely, he necessarily knows that also
                  definitely to which it is related. Now the head,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">the hand, and such things are substances, and it</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">is possible to know their essential character definitely, but
                  it</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">does not necessarily follow that we should know that</div>
               <div type="ic" n="7">to which they are related. It is not possible to know forthwith
                  whose head or hand is meant. Thus these are not relatives, and, this being</div>

            <div type="s" n="10">
               <div type="ic" n="1">the case, it would be true to say that no substance is relative
                  in character. It is perhaps a difficult matter, in such cases, to make a positive
                  statement without more exhaustive examination, but to have raised questions</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">with regard to details is not without advantage. Part 8 By
                  'quality' I mean that in virtue</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">'habit' or 'disposition'. Habit differs from disposition in
                  being more lasting and more firmly established. The various kinds of knowledge and
                  of virtue are habits, for knowledge, even when acquired only in a moderate degree,
                  is, it</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">such cause. The virtues, also, such as justice, self-restraint,

               <div type="ic" n="1">dislodged or dismissed, so as to give place to vice. By a

               <div type="ic" n="3">quickly gives place to its opposite. Thus, heat, cold, disease,
                  health, and so on are dispositions. For a man is disposed in one way or another
                  with reference to these, but quickly changes, becoming cold instead of warm, ill
                  instead of</div>

               <div type="ic" n="5">with all other dispositions also, unless through lapse of time a
                  disposition has itself become inveterate and almost impossible to dislodge: in

            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">we should perhaps go so far as to call it a habit. It is evident
                  that men incline to call those conditions habits which are of a more or less
                  permanent type and difficult to</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">displace; for those who are not retentive of knowledge, but
                  volatile, are not said to have such and such a 'habit' as regards knowledge, yet
                  they are disposed, we may say, either better or</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">worse, towards knowledge. Thus habit differs from disposition in
                  this, that while the latter in ephemeral, the former is permanent and difficult to
                  alter. Habits are at the same time dispositions, but dispositions are not
                  necessarily habits. For those who have some</div>

            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">specific habit may be said also, in virtue of that habit, to be
                  thus or thus disposed; but those who are</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">disposed in some specific way have not in all cases the
                  corresponding habit. Another sort of quality is that in virtue of which, for
                  example, we call men good boxers or runners, or healthy or sickly: in</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">fact it includes all those terms which refer to inborn capacity

         <div type="par" n="2">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">of an inborn capacity to accomplish something with ease. Men are
                  called healthy in virtue of the inborn capacity of easy resistance to those

               <div type="ic" n="1">of this capacity. Similarly with regard to softness and
                  hardness. Hardness is predicated of a thing because it has that capacity of
                  resistance which enables it to withstand</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">disintegration; softness, again, is predicated of a thing by
                  reason of the lack of that capacity. A third class within this category is that of
                  affective qualities and affections. Sweetness, bitterness, sourness, are examples
                  of this sort of quality, together with all that is akin to these; heat, moreover,
                  and cold, whiteness, and blackness are affective qualities. It is evident

                  Honey is called sweet because it contains sweetness; the body is called white

            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">in all other cases. The term 'affective quality' is not used as
                  indicating that those</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">things which admit these qualities are affected in any way.
                  Honey is not called sweet because it is affected in a specific way, nor is this

               <div type="ic" n="1">called affective qualities, not because those things which</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">admit them are affected. What is meant is</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">that these said qualities are capable of producing an
                  'affection' in the way of perception. For sweetness has the power of

                  Whiteness and blackness, however, and the other colours, are</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">not said to be affective qualities in this sense, but -because
                  they themselves are the results of an affection. It</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">is plain that many changes of colour take place because of
                  affections. When a man is ashamed, he blushes; when he is afraid, he becomes pale,
                  and so on. So true is this, that when a man is by nature liable to such
                  affections, arising from some concomitance of elements in his constitution, it is
                  a probable</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">inference that he has the corresponding complexion of skin. For
                  the same disposition of bodily elements, which in the former instance was

            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">the case of an access of shame, might be a result of a man's
                  natural temperament, so as to produce the corresponding colouring also as a
                  natural characteristic. All conditions, therefore, of this kind, if caused
                  by</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">certain permanent and lasting affections, are called affective
                  qualities. For pallor and duskiness of complexion are called</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">qualities, inasmuch as we are said to be such and such in virtue
                  of them, not only if they originate</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">in natural constitution, but also if they come about through
                  long disease or sunburn, and are difficult to remove, or indeed remain
                  throughout</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">life. For in the same way we are said to be such and such
                  because of these. Those conditions, however, which arise from causes which may
                  easily be rendered ineffective or speedily removed, are called, not qualities, but
                  affections: for</div>

            <div type="s" n="6">
               <div type="ic" n="1">we are not said to be such virtue of them. The man who blushes
                  through shame is not said to be a constitutional blusher, nor is the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">man who becomes pale through fear said to be constitutionally
                  pale. He is said rather to have been affected. Thus such conditions are called
                  affections, not qualities. In like manner there are affective qualities and
                  affections of the soul. That temper with which a man is born and which has its
                  origin in certain deep-seated affections is called a quality. I mean such
                  conditions as insanity, irascibility, and so on: for people are said to be mad or
                  irascible</div>

            <div type="s" n="7">
               <div type="ic" n="1">in virtue of these. Similarly those abnormal psychic states
                  which are not inborn, but arise from the concomitance of certain</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">other elements, and are difficult to remove,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">or altogether permanent, are called qualities, for in virtue of
                  them men are said to be such and such. Those, however, which arise from causes
                  easily rendered ineffective</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">are called affections, not qualities. Suppose that a man is
                  irritable when vexed: he</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="8">
               <div type="ic" n="1">is not even spoken of as a bad-tempered man, when in such

            <div type="s" n="9">
               <div type="ic" n="1">rather is said to be affected. Such conditions are therefore
                  termed, not qualities, but affections. The fourth sort of quality is figure and
                  the shape that belongs to a thing; and besides this, straightness</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">and curvedness and any other qualities of this type; each of

               <div type="ic" n="1">as being such and such. Because it is triangular or quadrangular
                  a thing is said to have a specific character, or again because it is straight or

            <div type="s" n="1">

                  or without teeth, but these are not called toothless or blind. To be without some
                  faculty or to possess it is not the same as the corresponding 'privative' or
                  'positive'. 'Sight' is a</div>

                  the same type of antithesis in both cases; for just as blindness</div>

            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">is opposed to sight, so is being blind opposed to having sight.
                  That which is affirmed or</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">denied is not itself affirmation or denial. By 'affirmation' we
                  mean an affirmative proposition, by 'denial' a negative. Now, those facts which
                  form the matter of the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">affirmation or denial are not propositions; yet these two are
                  said to be opposed in the same sense as the affirmation</div>

            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">and denial, for in this case also the type of antithesis is the
                  same. For as the affirmation is opposed to</div>

               <div type="ic" n="3">that 'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed each to each

               <div type="ic" n="1">reference to the other; sight is not sight of blindness, nor is
                  any other preposition used to indicate the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">relation. Similarly blindness is not said to be blindness of
                  sight, but rather, privation of sight. Relatives, moreover, reciprocate; if
                  blindness, therefore, were a relative, there would be a reciprocity of relation
                  between it</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="7">
               <div type="ic" n="1">and that with which it was correlative. But this is not the
                  case. Sight is not called</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">the sight of blindness. That those terms which fall under</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">the heads of 'positives' and 'privatives' are not opposed each
                  to each as contraries, either, is plain from the following facts: Of a pair of
                  contraries such that they have no intermediate, one or the other must needs</div>

               <div type="ic" n="3">which this necessity obtains, that have no intermediate.
                  Moreover, we cited health and disease, odd and even, as instances.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">But those contraries which have an intermediate are not subject
                  to any such necessity. It is not necessary that every substance, receptive of such
                  qualities, should be either black or white, cold</div>

            <div type="s" n="9">
               <div type="ic" n="1">or hot, for something intermediate between these contraries may
                  very well be present in the subject. We proved, moreover, that those contraries

               <div type="ic" n="2">the said necessity does</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">not obtain. Yet when one of the</div>

               <div type="ic" n="1">two contraries is a constitutive property of the subject, as it
                  is a constitutive property of fire to be hot, of</div>

            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">snow to be white, it is necessary determinately that one of the

                  cannot be cold,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">or snow black. Thus, it is not the case here that one of the two
                  must needs be present in every subject receptive of these qualities, but only
                  in</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">that subject of which the one forms a constitutive property.
                  Moreover, in such cases it is one</div>

               <div type="ic" n="5">neither of the aforesaid statements holds good. For it is not
                  necessary that a subject receptive of the qualities should always have either the

               <div type="ic" n="6">natural is not said either to be blind or to see. Thus
                  'positives' and 'privatives' do not belong to that</div>
               <div type="ic" n="7">class of contraries which consists of those which have no
                  intermediate. On the other hand, they do</div>
               <div type="ic" n="8">not belong either to that class which consists of contraries
                  which have an intermediate. For under certain conditions it is necessary that

            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">For when a thing has reached the stage when it is by nature

               <div type="ic" n="2">will be said either to see or to be blind, and that in an
                  indeterminate sense, signifying that the capacity may be either present or absent;
                  for it is not necessary either that it should see or that it should be blind, but
                  that it should be</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">either in the one state or in</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">the other. Yet in the case of those contraries which have an
                  intermediate we found</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">that it was never necessary that either the one or the other

               <div type="ic" n="2">of life and thought, may make some advance, however slight, and
                  if he should once improve, even ever so little, it is plain that he might change
                  completely, or at any rate make very great progress; for a man</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">becomes more and more easily moved to virtue, however small the
                  improvement was at first. It is, therefore, natural to suppose that he will</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">make yet greater progress than he has made in the past; and as
                  this process goes on, it will change him completely and establish him</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">in the contrary state, provided he is not hindered by lack of
                  time. In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', however, change in both
                  directions is impossible. There</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">may be a change from possession to privation, but not from
                  privation to possession. The man who has become blind does not regain</div>

                  and the other false. Neither in the case of contraries, nor in</div>

            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">the case of correlatives, nor in the case of 'positives' and
                  'privatives', is it necessary for one to be true and the other false.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">Health and disease are contraries: neither of them is true or
                  false. 'Double' and 'half' are opposed to each</div>

            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">other as correlatives: neither of them is true or false. The
                  case is the same, of course, with regard to 'positives' and 'privatives' such as
                  'sight' and 'blindness'. In short, where there is no sort of</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">combination of words, truth and falsity have no place, and all
                  the opposites we have mentioned so far consist</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">of simple words. At the same time, when the words which enter
                  into opposed statements are contraries, these, more than any other set of
                  opposites, would seem to</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">claim this characteristic. 'Socrates is ill' is the contrary of
                  'Socrates is well', but not even</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">of such composite expressions is it true to say that one of the
                  pair must always be true and the other</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">false. For if Socrates exists, one will be</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">true and the other false, but if he does not exist, both will be
                  false; for neither 'Socrates is ill' nor 'Socrates is well' is true, if Socrates
                  does not exist at all. In the case of 'positives' and 'privatives', if the subject
                  does not exist at all, neither proposition is true, but even if the subject
                  exists, it</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">is not always the fact that one is true and the other false. For
                  'Socrates has sight' is the opposite of</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">'Socrates is blind' in the sense of the word 'opposite' which
                  applies to possession and privation. Now if Socrates exists, it</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">is not necessary that one should be true and the other false,
                  for when he is not yet able to acquire the power of</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">vision, both are false, as also if Socrates is altogether
                  non-existent. But in the case of affirmation and negation, whether the subject
                  exists or not, one is always false and the other true. For manifestly, if Socrates
                  exists, one of the two propositions 'Socrates is ill', 'Socrates is not ill', is
                  true, and the other false. This is likewise the case if he does not exist; for if
                  he does not exist, to say</div>

            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">that he is ill is false, to say that he is not ill is true. Thus
                  it is in the case of those opposites only, which are</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">opposite in the sense in which the term is used with reference
                  to affirmation and negation, that the rule holds good, that one of the pair must

               <div type="ic" n="3">Part 11 That the contrary of a good is an evil is shown by

                  in a few cases, however, that we see instances of this: in most, the contrary of
                  an evil is a good. In the case of contraries, it</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">is not always necessary that if one exists the other</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">should also exist: for if all become healthy there will be
                  health and no</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">disease, and again, if everything turns white, there will be
                  white, but no black. Again, since the fact that Socrates is ill is</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">the contrary of the fact that Socrates is well, and two contrary
                  conditions cannot both obtain in one</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">and the same individual at the same time, both these contraries
                  could not exist at</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">once: for if that Socrates was well was a fact, then that
                  Socrates was ill could not possibly</div>

            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">be one. It is plain that contrary attributes must needs be
                  present in subjects which belong to the same species or genus. Disease and health
                  require as their subject the body of an animal; white and black require a body,
                  without further qualification;</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">justice and injustice require as their subject the human soul.
                  Moreover, it is necessary that pairs</div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div type="par" n="2">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">of contraries should in all cases either belong to the same
                  genus or belong to contrary genera or</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">be themselves genera. White and black belong to the same genus,
                  colour; justice and injustice, to contrary genera, virtue and vice; while good and
                  evil do not</div>

            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">belong to genera, but are themselves actual genera, with terms
                  under them. Part 12 There are four senses in which one thing can be</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">said to be 'prior' to another. Primarily and most properly the
                  term has reference to time: in this sense the word is used to indicate that one
                  thing is older or more ancient than another, for the expressions 'older' and 'more
                  ancient' imply greater length of time. Secondly, one thing is said to be 'prior'
                  to another when the sequence</div>
            </div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="ch" n="12">
         <div type="par" n="1">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">of their being cannot be reversed. In this sense 'one' is
                  'prior'</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">to 'two'. For if 'two' exists, it follows directly that 'one'
                  must exist, but if 'one' exists, it does not follow necessarily that 'two' exists:
                  thus the sequence subsisting cannot be reversed. It is agreed, then, that when the
                  sequence of</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">two things cannot be reversed, then that one on which the other
                  depends is called 'prior' to that other. In the third place, the term 'prior'
                  is</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">used with reference to any order, as in the case of science and
                  of oratory. For in sciences which use demonstration there is that which is prior
                  and that which is posterior in order; in geometry, the elements are prior to the
                  propositions; in reading and writing, the letters of the alphabet are prior to the
                  syllables. Similarly, in the</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">case of speeches, the exordium is prior in order to the
                  narrative. Besides these senses of the word, there is</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">a fourth. That which is better and more honourable is said to
                  have a natural priority. In common parlance men speak of those whom they honour
                  and love as 'coming first' with them. This sense of the word is perhaps the most
                  far-fetched. Such, then, are the different senses in which the term 'prior' is
                  used. Yet it would seem that besides those mentioned there is yet</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">another. For in those things, the being of each of which implies
                  that of the other, that which is in any</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">way the cause may reasonably be said to be by nature 'prior' to
                  the effect. It is plain that there are instances of</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">this. The fact of the being of a man carries with it the
                  truth</div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div type="par" n="2">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">of the proposition that he is, and the implication is
                  reciprocal: for if a man</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">is, the proposition wherein we allege that he is true, and
                  conversely, if the proposition wherein we allege</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">that he is true, then he is. The true proposition, however, is
                  in no way the cause of the being of the man, but the fact of the man's being does
                  seem</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">somehow to be the cause of</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">the truth of the proposition, for the truth or falsity of the
                  proposition depends on the fact of the man's being or not</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">being. Thus the word 'prior' may be used in five senses. Part 13
                  The term 'simultaneous' is</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">primarily and most appropriately applied to those things the
                  genesis of the one of which is simultaneous with that of the other;</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">for in such cases neither is prior or posterior to the other.
                  Such things are said to be simultaneous in point of time. Those things, again, are
                  'simultaneous' in point of nature, the being</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">of each of which involves that of the other, while at the same
                  time neither is</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">the cause of the other's being. This is the case with regard to
                  the double</div>
            </div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="ch" n="13">
         <div type="par" n="1">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">and the half, for these are reciprocally dependent, since, if
                  there is a double, there is also a</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">half, and if there is a half, there</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">is also a double, while at the</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">same time neither is the cause of the being of the other. Again,
                  those species which are distinguished one from another and opposed one to another
                  within the same genus are said to be 'simultaneous' in nature. I mean</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">those species which are distinguished each from each by one and
                  the same method of division. Thus the 'winged' species is simultaneous with the
                  'terrestrial' and the 'water' species. These are distinguished within the same
                  genus,</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">and are opposed each to each, for the genus 'animal' has the
                  'winged', the 'terrestrial', and the 'water' species,</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">and no one of these is prior or posterior to another; on the
                  contrary, all such things appear to be 'simultaneous' in nature.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">Each of these also, the terrestrial, the winged, and the water
                  species, can be divided again</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">into subspecies. Those species, then, also will be
                  'simultaneous' point of nature, which, belonging to the same genus, are
                  distinguished each from each by one and the same method of differentiation. But
                  genera are prior to species, for the sequence of</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">their being cannot be reversed. If there is the species
                  'water-animal', there will be the genus 'animal', but granted the being of
                  the</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">genus 'animal', it does not follow necessarily that there will
                  be the species 'water-animal'. Those things, therefore, are said to be
                  'simultaneous'</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">in nature, the being of each</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">of which involves that of the other, while at the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">same time neither is in any way the cause of the other's being;
                  those species, also, which are</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="6">
               <div type="ic" n="1">distinguished each from each and opposed within the same genus.
                  Those things, moreover, are 'simultaneous' in the unqualified sense of the word
                  which come into being at the same time. Part 14 There are six sorts of movement:
                  generation, destruction, increase, diminution, alteration, and</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">change of place. It is evident in all but one case that</div>
            </div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="ch" n="14">
         <div type="par" n="1">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">all these sorts of movement</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">are distinct each from each. Generation is distinct from
                  destruction, increase and change of place from diminution,</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">and so on. But in the case of alteration it may be argued that
                  the process</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">necessarily implies one or other of the other five sorts of
                  motion. This is not true, for we may say that all affections, or nearly</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">all, produce in us an alteration which is distinct from all
                  other sorts of motion, for that which is affected need not suffer either increase
                  or diminution</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">or any of the other</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">sorts of motion. Thus alteration is a distinct sort of motion;
                  for, if it were not, the thing altered would not only be altered, but would</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">forthwith necessarily suffer increase or diminution or some one
                  of the other sorts of motion in addition; which as a matter of fact is not the
                  case. Similarly that which was undergoing the process of increase or was
                  subject</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">to some other sort of motion would, if alteration were not a
                  distinct form of motion, necessarily be subject to alteration also. But there
                  are</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">some things which</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="4">
               <div type="ic" n="1">undergo increase but yet not alteration. The square, for
                  instance, if a gnomon is applied to it, undergoes</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">increase but not alteration, and so it is</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">with all other figures of this sort. Alteration and increase,
                  therefore, are distinct. Speaking generally, rest is the contrary of motion.</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">But the different forms of motion have their</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="5">
               <div type="ic" n="1">own contraries in other forms; thus destruction is the contrary
                  of generation,</div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div type="par" n="2">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">diminution of increase, rest in a place, of change of place.
                  As</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">for this last, change in the reverse direction would seem to be
                  most truly its contrary;</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">thus motion upwards is the contrary of motion downwards and vice
                  versa. In the case of that sort of motion which yet remains, of those that have
                  been enumerated, it is not easy to state what is its contrary. It</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">appears to have no contrary, unless one should define the
                  contrary here also either as 'rest in its quality' or as 'change in the direction
                  of the contrary quality', just as we defined the contrary of change of place
                  either as rest in a place or as change in the reverse direction. For a thing is
                  altered when change of quality takes place; therefore either rest in its quality
                  or change in the direction of the contrary may be called the contrary of this
                  qualitative form of motion. In this way becoming white is the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">contrary of becoming black; there is alteration in the contrary
                  direction, since a change of a qualitative nature takes place. Part 15 The term
                  'to have' is used in various senses. In the first place it is used with reference
                  to habit or</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">disposition or any other quality, for we are said to 'have' a
                  piece of knowledge or</div>
            </div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div type="ch" n="15">
         <div type="par" n="1">
            <div type="s" n="1">
               <div type="ic" n="1">a virtue. Then, again, it has reference to quantity, as, for
                  instance,</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">in the case of a man's height; for he is said to 'have' a height
                  of three or four cubits. It is</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">used, moreover, with regard to apparel, a man being said to
                  'have' a coat or tunic; or in respect of something which we have on a part
                  of</div>
               <div type="ic" n="4">ourselves, as a ring on the hand: or in respect of something
                  which</div>
               <div type="ic" n="5">is a part of us, as hand or</div>
               <div type="ic" n="6">foot. The term refers also</div>
               <div type="ic" n="7">to content, as in the case of a vessel and wheat, or of a jar
                  and wine; a jar is said to 'have' wine, and a corn-measure wheat. The expression
                  in such cases has</div>
               <div type="ic" n="8">reference to content. Or it refers to</div>
               <div type="ic" n="9">that which has</div>
               <div type="ic" n="10">been acquired; we are said to 'have'</div>
            </div>
            <div type="s" n="2">
               <div type="ic" n="1">a house or a field. A man is also</div>
               <div type="ic" n="2">said to 'have' a wife, and a wife a husband, and this appears to
                  be the</div>
               <div type="ic" n="3">most remote meaning of the term, for by the use of it we mean

            <div type="s" n="3">
               <div type="ic" n="1">that the husband lives with the wife. Other senses of the word
