            providing an overview of the fundamental principles and technologies behind TAN. The
            overall goal of this chapter is to summarize the theoretical and technological
            underpinnings that run throughout all TAN formats and to note definitions, assumptions,
            and other matters that broadly affect anyone working with TAN files. Although this
            chapter assumes no prior knowledge on your part of a particular technology, it is also
            not meant to be a tutorial. Links to further reading in this chapter will take you to
            introductory material that will provide thorough instruction or list it.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="d5e619"/>The Big Picture</h2></div></div></div><p>The Text Alignment Network is a suite of XML encoding formats. Each TAN format is
               designed for a specific type of textual data, organized in three classes: segmented
               representations of textual works (class 1), annotations of specific texts (class 2),
               and rules for linguistic concepts (Class 3). The number of classes may grow in the
               future to cover claims about text-bearing objects, for example codicology or
               stemmatics (the study of how manuscripts and other versions of a work relate to each
               other).</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Class 1</strong></span>, representations of textual objects,
               consists solely of transcription files. Each transcription file contains the text of
               a single work from a single text-bearing object, whether physical or digital (TAN
               regards digital files as objects). There are two types of transcription file, a
               standard generic format and another for TEI XML files. These two types are
               differentiated by the name of the rootmost element in the file,
                  <code class="code">&lt;TAN-T&gt;</code> and <code class="code">&lt;TEI&gt;</code> respectively. In the future,
               class 1 may expand to include formats intended to segment (and therefore align)
               visual, audio, or audiovisual files; it may also expand to include a customized form
               of HTML.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Class 2</strong></span>, annotations of textual representations,
               consists of alignment files and lexico-morphology files. There are two types of
               alignment, one for broad, general alignments and another that focuses on detailed
               specificity. The former, identified by the name <code class="code">&lt;TAN-A-div&gt;</code> in the
               rootmost element, aligns any number (one or more) of class 1 files. The latter,
                  <code class="code">&lt;TAN-A-tok&gt;</code>, aligns only pairs of class 1 files. Lexico-morphology
               files, <code class="code">&lt;TAN-LM&gt;</code>, are used to encode the lexical and morphological (or
               part of speech) forms of individual words in a given class 1 file. In the future,
               class 2 may expand to include syntax (treebanking).</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Class 3</strong></span>, rules for linguistic concepts, consists
               of tokenization patterns and morphological patterns. The first of these,
                  <code class="code">&lt;TAN-R-tok&gt;</code>, declares a pattern to be used to transform a string
               of text into a sequence of word tokens for linguistic analysis. The second type,
                  <code class="code">&lt;TAN-R-mor&gt;</code>, is used to declare the grammatical categories or
               features of a given language and to stipulate rules for classifying words. Class 3
               file may expand in the future to include transliteration, lexicography, and syntax. </p><p><span class="italic">Dependence and reference</span>: Class 1 files depend
               exclusively upon a single source—some text-bearing object (print or digital); they
               also refer to TAN-R-tok files. Class 2 files alone depend exclusively upon one or
               more class 1 files for their sources. They may also refer to class 3 files. Class 3
               files neither depend upon nor make reference to any other class of TAN file.</p><p>Below is a visualization of each TAN format type and the types of TAN files referenced.<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="img/TAN%20formats%20class%201.jpeg"/></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="img/TAN%20formats%20class%202.jpeg"/></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="img/TAN%20formats%20class%203.jpeg"/></span></p><p>TAN files that refer to or are referred to by other TAN files form a kind of
               network. Alignment files become the principal point of connection. Below is an
               illustration of a small network of TAN files.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="img/TAN%20example%20suite%202015-03.jpeg"/></span></p><p>This approach to text markup adopts what is sometimes called <span class="italic">stand-off annotation</span> (or <span class="italic">stand-off markup</span>). It is to be contrasted with <span class="italic">in-line annotation</span>, in which alignments, morphology, and so forth are
               built into the transcriptions themselves. Most TEI and HTML files exhibit in-line
               annotation. Stand-off annotation has been adopted so as to capitalize upon a number
               of benefits: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>An editor can work on a file with minimal distraction, focusing on a
                        limited set of closely related questions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Alignments can be made concurrent to any others that may already exist,
                        allowing for rich, complex, or alternative alignments. </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>After a dataset is published, any other datasets it refers to, or any
                        datasets referring to it, can be aggregated into much larger and more
                        complex datasets, which can then be queried to answer questions otherwise
                        impossible to answer.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Editorial labor can be done without central coordination, as individuals
                        work at their own pace, independently, on separate files.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Errors can be corrected in a single master file. Anyone depending upon
                        that master file as a source will be able to detect changes that have been
                        made and deal with them accordingly.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Any data file can be released, circulated, and used independent of any
                        other that points to it, or to which it points.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The TAN suite can be expanded to allow other types of linguistic data,
                        thereby expanding the complexity of questions that could be answered.</p></li></ul></div><p>Stand-off annotation is not without its liabilities. Dependent files might be
               altered or altogether deleted. Files might contain erroneous or misleading
               information. It can be sometimes inconvenient not to have the annotated text in the
               same file and place as the annotation. These liabilities mean that TAN files should
               not be seen as replacements for in-line annotation formats, especially those that set
               out to serve activities TAN was not designed to support. </p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="pt02.xhtml">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pt02.xhtml">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch04s02.xhtml">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Part II. Detailed Description </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.xhtml">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Assumptions in the Creation of TAN Data</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
