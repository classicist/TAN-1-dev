            consists solely of transcriptions, the foundation of any TAN-compliant project. No class
            2 files (e.g., alignment, morphology) can be created without class 1 files. </p><p>Transcriptions come in two different formats, identified by the rootmost element.
               <code class="code">&lt;TAN-T&gt;</code> is a simple, generic format, as close as one can get to plain
            text. <code class="code">&lt;TEI&gt;</code> (also referred to in this manual as TAN-TEI), on the other
            hand, is highly expressive. Because the two types function almost identically, the
            generic format is first presented in full, and is followed by a second part devoted to
            special features necessary for TEI.</p><p>The different encoding formats are illustrated throughout this and the next two
            chapters with two examples, a simple one, <span class="italic">Ring a Ring o'
               Roses</span> (see <a class="xref" href="ch02.xhtml" title="Chapter 2. Starting off with the TAN Format">Chapter 2, <em>Starting off with the TAN Format</em></a>), and a more complicated one,
            the <span class="emphasis"><em>Praktikos</em></span> by Evagrius of Pontus. </p><p>Where necessary, supplements from other examples will be provided to illustrate
            advanced features of the encoding rules.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="transcription_principles"/>Principles and Assumptions</h2></div></div></div><p>To maximize the utility of transcriptions within the TAN ecosystem, certain
               assumptions and recommendations are made regarding class 1 (transcription) files.
               These assumptions about transcriptions complement the more general ones; see <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.xhtml" title="Design Principles">the section called “Design Principles”</a>.</p><p>First, TAN transcription files are restricted exclusively to the creation of an
               accurate digital representation of a single version of a single work, correctly
               segmented and labeled and drawn from only one source. Editors of TAN-T or TAN-TEI
               files should be able to read, write, and proofread texts in the languages of the
               sources. They should understand the works well enough to segment them and label them.
               They should be familiar with the normalizing conventions adopted by scholars who work
               on texts from the same time, language, and culture. They should have some familiarity
               with how users of the text will want to segment the transcription on the basis of
               words.</p><p>Editors need not understand everything about their texts, such as where and how
               they are derived or the history of the work. They need not have any specialized skill
               in grammar or lexicology. They need not know the morphology of individual words, or
               how individual parts of the text have been translated. Those skills are reserved for
               other core TAN formats. </p><p>TAN-T(EI) editors stand at the beginning of a larger workflow for text alignment.
               It is critical that work not be published hastily, and only after careful
               proofreading, especially of white-space, which will significantly affect later use,
               especially in processes involving tokenization Many transcriptions, especially those
               of long texts, have typographical errors. But eliminating as many as possible before
               publication will maximize the utility of a TAN-T(EI) file.</p><p>If you are creating a TAN-T(EI) file, you are doing so primarily to service text
               alignment. To align is to correlate passages of text that attest to acts of text
               reuse, e.g., translating, paraphrasing, revising, quoting, and summarizing. Common to
               all these processes is that one or more texts, usually called the
                  <span class="emphasis"><em>source</em></span> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>sources</em></span>), are transformed
               into a new text, oftentimes called the <span class="emphasis"><em>target</em></span>. A target is based
               upon the semantics of the source and not its visible features. That is, translators,
               whether working literally or freely, move from idea to idea, clause to clause,
               sentence to sentence, and word to word. Line and page breaks in a source usually
               leave negligible if any trace in the target. Therefore a TAN transcription file
               should not try to reflect the appearance of its source (i.e., it should not be a
               diplomatic edition), and it should be structured, when possible, by the most familiar
               reference system for that work. If possible, semantic mileposts (clauses, sentences,
               paragraphs, chapters) not visual (lines, columns, pages, volumes) should be
               preferred. (But even alternative reference systems for the same text can be
               reconciled in the TAN format.)</p><p>Contributors and users of TAN files also assume a fundamental distinction between
               a textual object (or a text-bearing object) and a conceptual work. The former has
               materiality and the latter does not. Even though both are constitutively necessary
               for any transcription, the two must always be differentiated. For example, when we
               refer in ordinary conversation to the <span class="emphasis"><em>Odyssey</em></span> we refer to an
               idea, concept, or model, but not to a particular copy, version, or edition. On the
               other hand, if we encounter a book with <span class="emphasis"><em>The Odyssey</em></span> on the
               cover, we do not necessarily assume that it meets our ideal. It might contain only
               parts of it, or it might include other works. In ordinary conversation, we usually
               indicate whether our use of "Odyssey" refers to the work or to a specific copy. </p><p>Both the conceptual and physical categories are critical constraints a TAN-T(EI)
               file. In brief: <span class="emphasis"><em>Every TAN-T(EI) file must be restricted to a transcription
                  of a single version of a single conceptual work found on a single text-bearing
                  object, segmented and labeled according to a single reference system</em></span>.
               This restrictive principle is critical to the the success of the network, because it
               is the basis upon which other TAN files will be aligned. Adherence to the principle
               reduces the risk of confusion, simplifies the files, and allows complexity to be
               shifted from an individual file to the network in which that file
               participates.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Single textual object</strong></span>. Each TAN-T(EI) file
               transcribes one and only one object. It may be a digital file or a text-bearing
               artefact—a particular book, manuscript, stone, label, etc. If the object you've
               chosen is virtually indistinguishable from other related objects (e.g., copies of a
               printed book or copies of a digital file), then the entire class of mechanically
               reproduced objects is to be treated as a single object (an entity some librarians
               call a manifestation). Some borderline cases about what constitutes an object will
               require discernment and judgment. For example, some manuscripts have been split up,
               their parts now residing in multiple libraries around the world; other manuscripts
               have been physically altered or supplemented. In such cases, you may need to define
               your single text-bearing object in a way that might not conform strictly to how
               others might define it. You have the right and responsibility to define your object
               in the way that makes most sense to you and your users.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Single conceptual work</strong></span>. Identifying and defining
               the creative work you mean to transcribe is your decision. Suppose the text-bearing
               object you have is a Bible. It can take whatever contours you wish. For example,
               given that a text-bearing object is a New Testament, you may wish to define the
               entirety as a single work, or you may wish to make the work the Gospel of Matthew, or
               a specific episode in that gospel, or simply the Beatitudes. Any reasonable
               definition of a work is permitted, but a TAN-T(EI) file must contain nothing but the
               work that has been chosen. A TAN-T(EI) file need not contain the entire work. But it
               should be complete, and preserve the order found in the text-bearing object.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Single version</strong></span>. If the text-bearing object
               repeats the work in multiple versions (different languages or different editions),
               you must choose one and only one. If you wish to transcribe the other versions in
               your project, they should take separate TAN-T(EI) files. If you wish to work a
               transcription that is a critical edition or a collation of multiple versions of a
               text then it is best to prepare and publish separately a print or digital edition of
               that edition. That new edition can then be treated as the single version for your
               TAN-T file.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="img/note.png"/></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Transcriptions of unwritten texts</strong></span>. The term
                  "textual object" includes physical or digital media that preserve written, aural,
                  or performative text, e.g., a speech delivered in Russian or a dialogue performed
                  in American Sign Language. A TAN-T(EI) file may directly transcribe an oral or
                  performative text, as long as it adheres as faithfully as possible to the source,
                  and makes a full declaration of all normalizations that have been exercised. In
                  such cases a list might be quite extensive and unwieldy, so it may be preferable
                  to create and publish an independent transcription to then serve as the source of
                  a TAN-T(EI) file.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Domain model</strong></span>. The categories used in this
                  introduction may remind some readers of the domain model defined by the Functional
                  Requirements for Bibliographical Records (FRBR), which identifies four types of
                  Class 1 entities: <span class="emphasis"><em>Work</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Expression</em></span>,
                     <span class="emphasis"><em>Manifestation</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Item</em></span>, the first
                  pair being conceptual, non-material entities and the latter pair material ones.
                  The TAN encoding format is built upon a slightly different perspective. FRBR Items
                  are equivalent to what TAN calls <span class="emphasis"><em>objects</em></span> (a term chosen to
                  emphasize their materiality). Multiple objects that for all intents and purposes
                  are indistinguishable (i.e., items reproduced mechanically) are equivalent to FRBR
                  Manifestations, but in TAN no separate entity has been defined. It is best to
                  think of TAN objects as being equivalent to FRBR Items, with FRBR Manifestations
                  being sets of indistinguishable TAN objects. As for conceptual entities, the
                  network has been designed with the assumption that most TAN users will find the
                  distinction between Works and Expressions to be unhelpful or false. What one
                  person calls a FRBR Expression another may legitimately call a Work. TAN assumes
                  that any derivation of a Work (or Works) is itself a Work, which is really
                  shorthand for <span class="italic">work-version</span>. Thus, in this
                  manual the term <span class="emphasis"><em>version</em></span> indicates not an entity separate from
                  work, but rather a work that is known either to derive from another or to be the
                  basis for other derivations. TAN avoids altogether the term
                     <span class="emphasis"><em>Expression</em></span>, which necessarily implies a medium (without
                  which nothing can be expressed) and therefore materiality. </p><p>The above explanation is, for the moment, provisional. The concepts behind the
                  TAN conceptual model may be more precisely defined in the future.</p></td></tr></table></div><p><span class="bold"><strong>Single reference system</strong></span>. Every TAN transcription
               must be segmented into a hierarchy of uniquely labeled divisions. Those divisions,
               whenever possible, should align first and foremost according to the reference system
               that is most familiar when the text is cited across different versions, a so-called
               canonical reference system. (Because the canonicity of a reference system admits
               degrees and dispute, the simpler term <span class="italic">reference
                  system</span> is preferred and applies to all such systems, whether
               "canonical" or not.) Preference should be shown to the natural semantic divisions of
               the work, not the physical features of a particular object. Chapter, paragraph, and
               sentence numbers are preferable to volume, page, and line numbers, because other
               versions of the work (other translations, paraphrases) will only roughly, if at all,
               follow an object-oriented reference system. But if a given work has multiple systems
               (e.g., the works of Plato and Aristotle, which have both semantic- and
               object-oriented referenc systems), there are ways that both can be represented
               (explained below &lt;XREF pending&gt;).</p><p>If there is a good reference system, but the divisions are overly lengthy, you may
               introduce subdivisions. If there is no reference system, or if you think that the
               ones that exist are inadequate or misguided, you may create one of your own. If you
               develop your own reference system, be sure to make it useful and consistent, not just
               for your version but for any others of the same work. All references must be unique,
               and they must conform to a hierarchical model. Like XML itself, a reference system
               must follow a treelike hierarchy: one-to-many relationships from the root element
               down, with no overlapping siblings. </p><p>The previous paragraphs describe segmentation that usually applies to phrases,
               sentences, paragraphs, and similarly sized portions of text. But you must also
               prepare your files for token- or word-based segmentation. It is critical that you
               think about how to normalize the text to optimize tokenization (see <a class="xref" href="ch08.xhtml#tan-r-tok" title="Tokenization Patterns">the section called “Tokenization Patterns”</a>).</p><p>Judicious normalization is critical, especially of white space. You should be
               familiar with the conventions that are commonly used for identifying word tokens in
               the languages of your text. Some languages are relatively straightforward and word
               tokens can be isolated at word spaces. But in some languages word tokens might be
               joined with other word tokens, without any spaces. In these cases, the major words
               should be delimited by some consistent character, usually standardized white space,
               and the component words or morphemes should be delimited by nonstandardized white
               space. In many cases U+200B (ZERO-WIDTH SPACE) is appropriate as a delimitery within
               a string of characters to separate words. It is recommended that the spelled out XML
               entity be used (i.e., <code class="code">&amp;#x200B;</code>), so that editors and readers of the
               text can easily see where these markers have been set.</p><p>Other types of normalization that asist analysis and segmentation should also be
               undertaken. This usually entails the suppression of such elements extraneous to the
               text such as parenthetical editorial insertions, stray handwritten remarks,
               discretionary word-breaking hyphens, editorial comments, inserted cross-references,
               and reference numerals (page numbers, section numbers, etc.). In addition, you may
               wish to resolve ligatures and to correct unintended typographical errors. In a
               digital source, precise spacing marks you might be tempted to represent with General
               Punctuation (U+2000..U+200A; U+200B is a special case--see above) should be converted
               to ordinary spaces, and superscript combining Roman letters (U+0363..U+036F) should
               probably be converted to their non-combining counterparts. All Unicode must be
               normalized to NFC forms (see <a class="xref" href="ch04s03.xhtml#normalization" title="Normalization">Normalization</a>). Editors must declare
               what kind of tokenization their transcription has been optimized to take.</p><p>Not all decisions will be clear-cut. You may justly hesitate before normalizing
               orthography, punctuation, accentuation, or capitalization. Some aspects of Unicode
               that lend themselves to varying conventions may need special consideration. You may
               need to consider whether an unusual or rarely used Unicode character might be
               misinterpreted, or a hindrance to other users (especially for parsing word tokens).
               Describe any decisions that might not be agreeable to everyone who uses the file in
               the header (see <a class="xref" href="ch06s02.xhtml#filter_normalization" title="Filter: Normalizing, Replacing, Transliterating">the section called “Filter: Normalizing, Replacing, Transliterating”</a>).</p><p>You should remove from the text anything that is not part of the work proper and
               would interfere with detailed word-for-word alignment, or would create many extra
               hours of preprocessing or postprocessing work for later users. If your source is an
               electronic text that has preserved line breaks, you may need to ensure that the
               sibling elements that split the single word have no space (including line breaks) in
               any intervening text node. By default, XML treats multiple instances of space
               characters (space, tab, newline, and carriage return) as a single space. If retention
               of multiple spaces is important for your research, then the TAN formats are not an
               appropriate XML format, because it relies upon space normalization.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch05s04.xhtml">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="pt02.xhtml">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch06s02.xhtml">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Data (<code class="code">&lt;body&gt;</code>) </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.xhtml">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> General Transcriptions (<code class="code">&lt;TAN-T&gt;</code>)</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
