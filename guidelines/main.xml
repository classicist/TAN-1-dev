                  <para>This version is known to have significant omissions. In case of
                     contradictions, apparent or not, between the schemas and these guidelines, the
                     greatest weight is to be given to the RELAX-NG schemas (compact syntax), then
                     to these guidelines, and then to the Schematron schemas.</para>
                  <para>Chapters 1, 4-8 are relatively accurate. Chapter 2 was drafted in mid-2015,
                     before major changes to the schemas. Chapter 3 remains unwritten until the
                     format reaches some maturity, and is being used independently by at least three
                     projects. Chapter 8 reflects formats that need to be tested and refined against
                     real-life examples. Chapter 9 is highly experimental, and included only for the
                     sake of completeness.</para>
                  <para>TAN is meant to encourage collaboration and distributed scholarship. If you
                     are part of a project that would like to use and help develop the TAN format,
                     please contact the author (see above).</para>

      <title>General Overview</title>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <section>
            <title>Definition and audience </title>
            <para>The Text Alignment Network (TAN) is a suite of XML encoding formats and associated
               rules and recommended practices, intended to serve anyone who wishes to encode,
               exchange, and study translations, paraphrases, adaptations, quotations, and other
               varieties of text reuse. TAN is meant primarily to support research in philology,
               linguistics, translation studies, and any scholarly field concerned with the
               interpretation of textual reuse or versions of texts.</para>
            <para>The format is designed to handle any text written in a Unicode-supported writing
               system, and from any period, from antiquity to the recent past. TAN files have been
               designed to be maximally readable and editable by both humans and machines, and to be
               both syntactically and semantically interoperable. The TAN format is suitable not
               only as export/import format for tools but, in many cases, for native use. </para>
            <para>Built upon stand-off annotation, the TAN format allows scholars to edit and study
               the same texts independently and collaboratively. TAN schemas are written not only to
               ensure  validation, but to provide feedback and assistance to anyone editing and
               correcting TAN files. Because the format has well-defined rules, it comes with a
               library of functions that definitively interpret the format and pre-process the
               files, thereby assisting developers creating TAN-based tools and applications.</para>
            <para> Although expressive of scholarly nuance and complexity, TAN files are meant to
               benefit everyone, to be used in broad applications such as multilingual publishing,
               language learning, and machine translation.</para>
         </section>
         <section>
            <title>Rationale and purpose</title>
            <para>Translations, quotations, paraphrases, and so forth—all forms of text reuse—are
               important sources for scholars. Some texts have been lost in their original form and
               can be studied only through later translations, paraphrases, or quotations. And even
               when an original survives, these later versions are often worth study, revealing as
               they do something of the genius or idiosyncrasies of those who translated or quoted
               the original, which in turn sheds light on how words, concepts, and works were
               preserved or altered, shaped or combined across the generations and cultures who read
               and circulated the versions.</para>
            <para>The comparative study of versions of texts requires, as a foundation, some way to
               align words, sentences, paragraphs, and other text segments. Such alignment can be
               challenging. Identifying which words or phrases in a translation correspond to which
               words or phrases in the original might result in complex, overlapping sets. And even
               larger segments such as sentences and paragraphs may not line up well. Further, every
               version of a text is part of a much larger, complex history of text reuse, and proper
               study of that context requires not only multiple versions of multiple works, but
               collaboration across projects and fields of study.</para>
            <para>The Text Alignment Network aims to provide an XML encoding format that permits the
               exchange of detailed independent scholarship on versions of texts. TAN files adopt a
               syntax suitable for humans to read and edit, expressive enough to allow scholars to
               register doubt and nuance, and sufficiently structured to permit complex
               computer-based queries across independent datasets. The format is designed to allow a
               person to concentrate on a set of tasks associated with a specific activity (editing,
               grammatical analysis, word alignment, etc.) without having to worry about other types
               of analysis. The format compels editors to declare their views or assumptions about
               language and texts in a structured manner, so that other users of the data (both
               human and computer) can determine whether the data is suitable for their needs.
               Because nearly all TAN data must be expressed in both human- and computer-readable
               forms, the information can be used in semantic web applications.</para>
            <para>TAN has been designed to support specific research questions such as the
               following:</para>
            <para>
               <itemizedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>How do I encode a text I wish to share in such a way that it is likely to
                        align with other versions of that text?</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>How do I encode quotations of one work in another such that the data
                        might apply to multiple versions of either work?</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>How do I share texts, alignments, or other linguistic data such that
                        anyone using the data will be aware when I make corrections or changes to
                        the material?</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>How do I align multiple versions of a single work when those versions may
                        not match very well, or when the reason for alignment may be vague or
                        ambiguous?</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>How do I make detailed alignments between a source and its translation,
                        when there may be messy many-to-many relationships, and where I might need
                        to express doubt or alternative possibilities of alignment?</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>How do I create a detailed alignment between a source and its translation
                        such that, once completed, the dataset can be interrogated to find out how a
                        certain class of words (roots, part of speech, etc.) gets translated in the
                        target language, and with what frequency?</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>How do I answer the above questions such that my data can be used
                        interoperably by others?</para>
                  </listitem>
               </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            <para>The last question is especially significant, because it is expected that as
               persons or projects share or publish their TAN-compliant texts, there will emerge a
               decentralized corpus of texts along with stylesheets, tools, and applications that
               use TAN texts. As this TAN-compliant corpus grows, its interoperability will allow
               the repertoire of research questions to expand beyond any single-project corpora, to
               allow scholars to fruitfully investigate broader, comparative questions such as:<itemizedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>For classical Greek texts, how were words with the root -ιστημι ("stand")
                        translated into ancient Latin? In what specific ways did the vocabulary of
                        technical terms shift from pre-Christian translations into later, Christian
                        ones?</para>
                  </listitem>

                        texts, attested by Dao An (312-385 CE), compare to reforms in the seventh
                        and eighth centuries of Syriac translations of Greek texts?</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>How do Arabic translations of Greek texts from the Abbasid period differ
                        from those of Sanskrit?</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>Can an anonymous English translation of a modern French novel be
                        identified with known translators of French novels from the same
                        period?</para>

               </itemizedlist></para>
            <para>These ambitions behind these questions should be tempered by cautions about what
               TAN is not intended to do:<itemizedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>TAN is not a tool. It is a format. Just as other file formats, such as
                        JPEG, CSV, RTF, and so forth, TAN does not dictate what tools or
                        applications should be used to create, edit, or display TAN-compliant
                        files.</para>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>TAN does not create alignments or, on its own, answer research questions.
                        It merely lays the foundation for such questions to be investigated.
                        Separate applications, stylesheets, and other tools must be developed to use
                        the format for research.</para>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>TAN is not meant to support linguistic data beyond its scope (defined and
                        explained in these guidelines). That is, TAN is a supplement, not a
                        replacement, for other markup formats such as TEI, docbook, and so forth, or
                        other alignment formats such as XLIFF or TMX.</para>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>TAN is not meant to be the most computationally efficient format. XML by
                        its very nature sacrifices terseness—a cardinal virtue for computational
                        efficiency—in favor of human readability. TAN is meant, first and foremost,
                        to support lossless, interoperable exchange in a format transparent to human
                        editors and readers.</para>

         <section>
            <title>Creating TAN Transcription and Alignment Data</title>
            <para>Let us take a simple example, that of aligning two English versions of the nursery
               rhyme <emphasis role="italic">Ring-a-ring-a-roses</emphasis>, sometimes known as
                  <emphasis role="italic">Ring around the Rosie</emphasis>. Our goal here is to
               publish two versions of the nursery rhyme in the TAN format so that they are most
               likely alignable with any other TAN version of the poem that might be
               published.</para>
            <para>We begin by finding the versions we want. In this case we use exemplars published
               in <link xlink:href="http://lccn.loc.gov/12032709">1881</link> and <link
                  xlink:href="http://lccn.loc.gov/87042504">1987</link>, the former from the UK the
               latter from the US. Each of these books have other rhymes, but we've already decided
               to focus upon one particular nursery rhyme, so we transcribe them and nothing
                  else:<table frame="all">

               </table></para>
            <para>We must be sure to save each of the two transcriptions as plain Unicode text,
               preferably with <code>.xml</code> at the end of each file name. If you use a word
               processor (Word, OpenOffice, Google Docs, and so forth) you must be certain to save
               the file as plain text, in Unicode encoding (not Western European or other
               encodings). But even then you have to beware, because these programs can be too
               sophisticated for our work and sometimes generate erroneous formats. Word processors
               are in fact a bit too powerful for our purposes. We will be working with raw text,
               and will not be altering colors, fonts, margins, and so forth. Much better for our
               work is a <link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">text
                  editor</link>. And even better still would be an <link
                  xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_editor">XML editor</link>, which does
               the same thing a text editor does, but does other things too, such as tell us when
               our XML file is invalid, or provide shortcuts that save much typing.<note>
                  <para>Software suitable for your needs comes in many styles and prices. In

                     to use at first. Be certain to take advantage of tutorials and documentation
                     associated with any XML editor you begin to use.</para>
               </note></para>
            <para>Our first task is to get these two versions into separate files with the
               appropriate markup. Each TAN transcription file has two major parts: a head and a
               body. For now, we focus on only the second part, the body, as well as a few the
               necessary preliminary lines that stand above both the head and the body. First, the
               1881 (UK) version:

               And now the 1987 (US) version:

   &lt;/body>
&lt;/TAN-T></emphasis></programlisting>
            </para>
            <para>These are standard eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files. (If you are already
               familiar with this format you may wish to skip ahead.) XML is rather simple. It
               provides a way to take a text or a collection of data and give it some structure
               through markup. In the examples above, the markup is in boldface.</para>
            <para>Each file begins with a prolog, marked by the lines that begin with
                  <code>&lt;?</code>. The first line in each prolog simply states that what follows
               is an XML document. The next two lines point to the files that will be used to check
               to see whether or not our data is valid. For now we will skip the specific details.
               These three lines will be identical, or nearly so, from one TAN transcription file to
               the next, and we can simply cut and paste when we want to start a new one.</para>
            <para>The fourth line is the opening tag of what is called the root element, here called
                  <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code>. That opening tag, <code>&lt;TAN-T...></code> is answered
               by a closing tag, <code>&lt;/TAN-T></code>, the last line. The same thing happens
               with all the other elements in this example. <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> is answered by
                  <code>&lt;/head></code>, <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> by <code>&lt;/body></code> and
               each <code>&lt;div...></code> by <code>&lt;/div></code>. These elements nest within
               or alongside each other, but they never overlap. (The prohibition on overlapping
               elements is one of the cardinal rules of XML.) This relationship means that every XML
               file can be thought of as a tree, with the root at the trunk and the enveloped
               elements as branches, terminating in metaphorical leaves. It is helpful to use the
               tree metaphor when we describe the path we take, either toward the leaves or the
               root. In this manual, we may use the terms <emphasis role="italic"
                  >rootward</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">rootmost</emphasis>, <emphasis
                  role="italic">leafward</emphasis>, and <emphasis role="italic">leafmost</emphasis>
               when we want to trace movement within an XML document.</para>
            <para>An XML document is also profitably thought of as a family tree, a metaphor that
               provides terminology that will be very common. In our examples above,
                  <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code> is the <emphasis role="italic">parent</emphasis> of
                  <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>, and <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> the parent of the four
                  <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> elements. Vice versa, each <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> is the
                  <emphasis role="italic">child</emphasis> of <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>, and
                  <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> is the child of <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code>. Distant parental
               relationships can be described with the terms <emphasis role="italic"
                  >ancestor</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">descendant</emphasis>.
                  <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code> is the ancestor of every element it encompasses, and every
               element encompassed by <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code> is its descendant. Paratactic
               relationships are also important. <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> and <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>
               are <emphasis role="italic">siblings</emphasis> to each other, and every
                  <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> is a sibling to every other <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>.</para>
            <para>Inside of the opening tags for the <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code>,
               <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>, and <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> elements are pairs of text joined
               by an equals sign. The left side of each pair is called an attribute, and on the
               right side, within the quotation marks, is the value. <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code> has two
               attributes, <code>@xmlns</code> and <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code> (attributes are commonly
               referred to with @ before the name). We will skip <code>@xmlns</code> for now; this
               attribute (actually, a pseudo-attribute) specifies the namespace of the XML file, a somewhat advanced topic. </para>
            <para>The value of <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code>, however, is quite important and our first item of
               business. Every TAN file has an <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code> that uniquely and permanently
               identifies the file itself. It is quite similar to the name we give a file when we
               save it, and to the names we see when we browse through our files, except that it
               should not be changed. When we make corrections to our work, we will not change the
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code> value. We simply note a change (to be discussed later) with the
               date of the change.</para>
            <para>The value of <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code> is always what is called a tag uniform resource name
               (tag URN). It always starts with <code>tag:</code>, followed by an email address or
               domain name that we owned on a given day. (It is okay to use an obsolete address.)
               After that email address or domain name comes a comma (no spaces) and a date on which
               we owned it, in the international standard format of year, month, and date, joined by
               hyphens, e.g., 2014-12-31. If we leave off a day value, it is assumed to be the first
               of the month; if we leave off the month value it is assumed to be January. In the
               examples above, <code>[USER@DOMAIN.NET],2014</code> indicates that the email address
               was owned on the stroke of midnight (Coordinated Universal Time) January 1, 2014.
               After that comes a colon, and then any name we wish to assign to the file. <note>
                  <para>Many if not most TAN files will be circulated under a liberal license,
                     encouraging people to modify and use the data freely, with attribution. If you
                     decide to modify someone else's TAN file, and you become responsible for
                     changes, not the original person or organization. Your first point of order
                     should be to change the email address or domain name at the heart of the tag
                     URN, substituting one that you own or owned. The element <code><link
                           linkend="element-see-also">&lt;see-also></link></code> should be used to
                     credit the original. If you do not make this change, you are incorrectly
                     passing the work off as someone else's.</para>
               </note></para>
            <para>We have anticipated a simple collection of texts, so we've called the files
                  <code>ring01</code> and <code>ring02</code>. (If we run out of names, or want to
               restart, we can simply use a new email-date preface, e.g.,
                  <code>[USER@DOMAIN.NET],2014-01-02</code>.)</para>
            <para>The element <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> contains our transcription.
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-xmllang">@xml:lang</link></code>, required, specifies the principal language of the
               transcribed text. We use the standard 3-letter abbreviation for English. (See later
               in the guide for more complex language requirements.) By saying that
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-in-progress">@in-progress</link></code> is <code>false</code>, we indicate that we have
               finished our transcription and have no further plans to develop it. It doesn't mean
               that the file is error free. We will have the option to make corrections later. It
               just means that we have done all the work that we intended, and any further changes
               will be restricted to corrections of errors. This attribute is optional; if left off,
               the TAN file is assumed to be a work in progress.</para>
            <para>Our transcription has been divided into four <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> elements. How
               we divide up the work is entirely up to us. But we must make sure that every bit of
               text is enclode by a leafmost <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>. That is, every
                  <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> must be the parent of only other <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s, or
               none at all. We cannot have a <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> that mixes any text or other
               elements with other <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s. The values of <code><link linkend="attribute-type">@type</link></code> and
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-n">@n</link></code> indicate, respectively, the type of division and the name of the
               division. We have used <code>line</code> in the first example, but we could easily
               have also used <code>l</code> (as we did in the second) or <code>ln</code> or any
               other phrase that we think will make intuitive sense to other users (we will see why
               below). We have used arabic numerals for the values of <code><link linkend="attribute-n">@n</link></code>, but the
               value, once again, could have been anything. But since other people may use our work,
               we have adopted the naming scheme that seems most common and expected.</para>
            <para>Aside from the <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> element (discussed later), that's all we
               need in the transcription. We can now move to alignment.</para>
            <para>There are two different types of alignment, one emphasizing breadth, the other,
               depth. The broad type of alignment, called TAN-A-div, allows us to specify TAN
               transcriptions of as many versions of as many works as we wish, and to fine-tune the
               alignment upon the basis of the <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> elements within the
               transcription. We do not specify why we wish to align the versions. We only declare
               our interest in doing so. The type of alignment emphasizing depth, called TAN-A-tok,
               allows us to take any two (and no more) TAN transcriptions and specify word-to-word
               (or better put, token-to-token) relationships, and specify what type of relationship
               holds between them. TAN-A-div is suitable for work that focuses on the general
               alignment of multiple versions of one or more works at a single time. TAN-A-tok is
               for highly detailed, precise alignment of two text versions.</para>
            <para>For our example, we start with a TAN-A-div file (once again suppressing
                  <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>):<programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body/>
&lt;/TAN-A-div></programlisting></para>
            <para>In the prolog, the first line is identical to the first line of our transcription
               files. The second and third lines are identical, aside from pointing to the
               validation files for alignment. Even the fourth line looks like the transcription
               file, other than the new name for the root element, <code><link linkend="element-TAN-A-div">&lt;TAN-A-div></link></code>, and
               the new value for <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code>.</para>
            <para>The penultimate line, <code>&lt;body/></code>, is what is called an empty element,
               and is equivalent to <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link>&lt;/body></code>. Collapsing the opening and the
               closing tags of the element into a single tag provides a shorthand syntax for
               elements contains nothing. It will become apparent, when we discuss
                  <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> below, why our <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> can be empty.</para>
            <para>The other kind of alignment, TAN-A-tok, takes a bit more work, because we must
               first identify words that correspond with each other. Even before we do that, we need
               to decide what kind of relationship holds between the two texts. Let us pretend, for
               the sake of illustration, that the 1987 version is a direct descendant (and therefore
               variation) of the 1881 version. We therefore see our task as creating a map of how
               the older version became the newer one. There are different ways of approaching this
               task and deciding on the specifics is not as straightforward as some might think. We
               will also assume for this example that punctuation is both irrelevant and a marker
               between words, better termed in this context as <emphasis>tokens</emphasis>
                  (<emphasis role="italic">word</emphasis> is notoriously difficult to define, and
               the substitute <emphasis>token</emphasis> lacks many undesirable
               implications).</para>

            <para>Once again, the first four lines, the prolog and root element, should look
               familiar, with the only significant changes being the names of the validation files,
               the name of the root element (<code><link linkend="element-TAN-A-tok">&lt;TAN-A-tok></link></code>) and the value of
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code>.</para>
            <para>The heart of the data is <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>, which has, in addition to
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-in-progress">@in-progress</link></code>, two more attributes, <code><link linkend="attribute-reuse-type">@reuse-type</link></code>, which
               specifies the default type of relationship between the two sources, and
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-bitext-relation">@bitext-relation</link></code>, which specifies how the versions relate to each
               other. Our two values, <code>B-descends-from-A</code> and <code>adaptation</code>,
               are arbitrary names that we define in the <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> (discussed later). </para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> is the parent of one or more <code><link linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code>
               elements, each of which correlates a set of tokens in the two texts through its
                  <code><link linkend="element-tok">&lt;tok></link></code> children. Each <code><link linkend="element-tok">&lt;tok></link></code> has, in this example,
               three attributes. <code><link linkend="attribute-src">@src</link></code> takes a nickname (an <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code> reference)
               that points to one of the two transcriptions; we have used <code>ring1881</code> and
                  <code>ring1987</code> but we could have just as easily used anything else such as
                  <code>uk</code> and <code>us</code>. <code><link linkend="attribute-ref">@ref</link></code> has a value that points to
               a specific <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> in the source transcription; and <code><link linkend="attribute-pos">@pos</link></code>
               or <code><link linkend="attribute-val">@val</link></code> specify which token is intended, either by word number
                  (<code><link linkend="attribute-pos">@pos</link></code>) or text of the actual word (<code><link linkend="attribute-val">@val</link></code>). Either
               technique is fine, and can be mixed, as in the example. You may also notice that the
               comma and hyphen can be used in <code><link linkend="attribute-pos">@pos</link></code> to point to multiple words within
               the same <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>, and that <code>last</code> and <code>last-X</code>
               (where <code>X</code> is a digit) can be used to point to a word token relative to
               the last one in a <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>.</para>
            <para>Each <code><link linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code> can establish one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one,
               or many-to-many relationships between the two texts. It is perfectly fine to have the
               same word represented in multiple <code><link linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code> elements. And if an
                  <code><link linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code> has <code><link linkend="element-tok">&lt;tok></link></code> elements belonging to only one
               source, such as in the fourth-to-last <code><link linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code> above, we have what is
               called, in these guidelines, a <emphasis>half-null alignment</emphasis>. That is to
               say, using our example, that we have stated that the second word of line four of the
               1881 version is excluded from the act that we have called <code>adaptation</code>
               (which is, as we shall see, defined in the <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>). If this were a
               translation, it would be as if we were saying that this word was excluded from the
               translation. (If this was a half-null alignment for the later source, we would say
               that it was a word that the translator added.) A half-null alignment is not to be
               confused with our own silence. If we nowhere mention a token in our TAN-A-tok file,
               and if we specify through <code><link linkend="attribute-in-progress">@in-progress</link></code> that our work is finished, then
               we are saying only that we have nothing to say about it.</para>
            <para>We could have aligned the two texts in different ways. Perhaps further study will
               reveal that we were in error to associate the second "ring" with "round" is line 1.
               We can make corrections, even after publication, and signal the change to users of
               our data. There are also ways to express doubt or alterative opinions. We can even
               correlate fragments of tokens (letters, prefixes, infixes, or suffixes). All these
               more advanced uses are discussed in later chapters of these guidelines.</para>
            <para>For now, we have finished everything for two TAN transcriptions and two alignment
               files, except for the <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>. Before getting into details, we need
               first to discuss (1) the principles behind the TAN <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> and (2) how
               to ensure that the data in <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> is both human readable and computer
               readable.</para>
         </section>
         <section>
            <title>The Principles of TAN Metadata (<code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>)</title>
            <para>Unlike <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>, which carries the raw data, <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>
               contains what is oftentimes called metadata. That is, <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> takes
               data that describes the data. Because the TAN format is intended primarily to serve
               scholars, some metadata requirements are stricter than those in other formats.
               Scholars who use our data really need to know some essential things before
               thoughtfully studying and handling the data we produce. For example, what are the
               sources we have used? Who produced the data? When? What key assumptions have been
               made in producing the data? What rights do other people have to use the data? The
               questions are not difficult to answer, but they are critical.</para>
            <para>Some of these questions are specific to certain types of data, and others can be
               applied universally, no matter what kind of data. We have seen that the TAN
               transcription <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>s look quite different from those in the two
               alignment files. And there are other kinds of TAN files that cover other types of
               data, such as lexicomorphology and tokenization rules. And TAN may grow to cover
               other kinds of information. So <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> has been concisely and
               predictably structured so it can apply across all TAN formats. This reduces potential
               confusion and makes it easier for other people using our data to find the information
               they want.</para>
            <para>The rigorous scholarly requirements for TAN metadata are offset somewhat by
               another principle that was adopted in the design of TAN, namely, that each format's
                  <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> should focus upon describing the data in
                  <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> and not other things. That is to say, for the two
               transcriptions in our example above, we should definitely indicate what our sources
               are. But we should not do what librarians do so much better and try to write a
               catalog entry describing the books we have used. Anyone who really wants that
               information should go elsewhere. We need merely point to those other places. The TAN
               format does not forbid us from providing this information. But the
                  <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> is designed so that we can stay focused on the task and
               data at hand.</para>
            <para>TAN was also designed with the assumption that all metadata should be useful to
               both humans and computers. For our example above, we must describe the work we have
               chosen in such a way that <emphasis role="italic">Ring around the Rosie</emphasis> is
               comprehensible not just to the reader but to the computer, using syntax that a
               computer can act upon.</para>
            <para>Take for example the 1881 book we have used for our first transcription. For the
               human reader we can say simply something like "Kate Greenaway, <emphasis>Mother
                  Goose</emphasis>, New York, G. Routledge and sons [1881]". But computers need a
               more controlled, predictable syntax before they can be directed to the correct
               edition of <emphasis>Mother Goose.</emphasis> The human-readable string is too
               complex, and syntactically opaque. Perhaps a better identifier for a computer would
               be international standard book numbers (ISBNs), which not only distinguish the 1984
               version illustrated by Kayoko Okumura Cussler's novel from the 1984 version
               illustrated by William Joyce but can be used to distinguish the various types of
               editions: hardback, paper, electronic, and so forth. The ISBNs for the Okumura
               version, 0671493159, and for Joyce's, 0394865340, can be converted into a
               machine-actionable string called universal resource names (URNs), in this case
                  <code>urn:isbn:0-671493159</code> and <code>urn:isbn:0-394865340</code>. (Our 1881
               version was published before the ISBN program was introduced, but we will see below
               other ways to name it.)</para>
            <para>URNs are formalized naming schemes that are regulated by a central body (Internet
               Assigned Numbers Authority, IANA) to ensure that people and organizations can
               legitimately coin and use permanent, persistent, unique names for various types of
               things. Ther are URN schemes for journals (by means of ISSNs), articles (DOIs), and
               movies (ISANs), thereby allowing one to refer to them with a unique string that a
               computer can process.</para>
            <para>All URNs are simply names. They don't tell you where an object is, just what its
               name is. To provide a unique <emphasis role="italic">location</emphasis>, however, we
               have universal resource locators (URLs), which might be much more familiar from daily
               use of the Internet, e.g., <code>http://academia.edu</code>. Like URNs, URLs are also
               centrally regulated, with individuals or organizations buying the rights to domain
               names from a central registry (usually through a third-party vendor).</para>
            <para>Both URNs and URLs can be thought of as the same type of thing, namely, a
               universal resource identifier (URI), sometimes called an international resource
               identifier (IRI) to make clear that any alphabet in Unicode, not just Latin, may be
               used. URIs/IRIs are, in essence, nothing more than the set of all URNs and URLs.
               These four acronyms can be easily confused, and it is best to disambiguate them by
               thinking of the last letter in each. URIs/IRIs <emphasis role="bold"
               >I</emphasis>ncorporate both <emphasis role="bold">L</emphasis>ocators and <emphasis
                  role="bold">N</emphasis>ames.</para>
            <para>IRIs are essential to a system frequently called the semantic web or linked (open)
               data, an agreed way of writing and processing data that relies upon IRIs and a simple
               data model to connect them. The semantic web allows independent parties to make
               assertions about things, and if they happen to use the same IRI vocabulary to
               describe those things, computers can make associations between disparate,
               heterogenous datasets. This allows computers to make connections that humans might
               not make on their own. For example, a computer could be used to plot the geographical
               distribution of specific books in different library systems, if it has access to
               published IRIs in different online library catalogs.</para>
            <para>TAN has been designed to be linked-data friendly, and so requires in its head
               almost all data to be representable not just in a human readable form but also as an
               IRI, so computers can act upon the data. (It is this requirement that makes possible
               another principle mentioned earlier, that we should provide metadata about our data
               and not about other things.)</para>
            <para>Our first task, then, in writing the <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> sections of our four
               TAN files is to look for IRI vocabulary that will be familiar to the community of
               practice most likely to use our files. In trying to find suitable IRIs, we will find
               that the persons, things, and concepts we want to describe will be range from
               generally familiar to generally unfamiliar.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Generally familiar</emphasis>: The two books that provide
               the basis of our transcription are well catalogued and generally known. A number of
               services provided by librarians provide a controlled IRI vocabulary that can be used
               by anyone to describe uniquely a particular version of a book. <link
                  xlink:href="http://www.worldcat.org">WorldCat</link> (run by OCLC) and the <link
                  xlink:href="http://catalog.loc.gov">Library of Congress</link> are good examples.
               In our case, we have found accurate Library of Congress IRIs for both editions of
                  <emphasis>Mother Goose</emphasis>: <code>http://lccn.loc.gov/12032709</code> and
                  <code>http://lccn.loc.gov/87042504</code>. Observe that these two IRIs are, more
               specifically, URLs. If we paste these strings into our browser, we retrieve a record
               that describes the book. But this locator has not taken us to the book per se, only
               to information <emphasis role="italic">about</emphasis> the book. That is because,
               under the principles of linked data, a person or entity who owns a domain name can
               mint URLs based on that domain name <emphasis role="italic">also as names for
                  objects</emphasis>. This subtle point can sometimes be confusing to those who are
               new to the semantic web, because URLs conflate locations and names. Much of the
               motivation for this decision is convenience: by giving an object a name that is also
               a URL, you can then set up a server to tell a computer or a human more information
               about the object that is given that URL's name.</para>
            <para>Let's now find an IRI to name the work we have chosen, <emphasis role="italic"
                  >Ring around the Rosie</emphasis>. The work is widely known, and even has a <link
                  xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_a_Ring_o%27_Roses">Wikipedia
                  entry</link>. That Wikipedia entry is fortuitous. The Universities of Leipzig and
               Mannheim and Openlink Software have collaborated on a project called <link
                  xlink:href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/About">DBPedia</link>, which is committed to
               providing a unique URN for every Wikipedia entry in the major languages. The DBPedia
               URN for the work we have chosen is
                  <code>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ring_a_Ring_o%27_Roses</code>. Once again, this
               is both a name and a locator. It names a specific intangible object, namely a nursery
               rhyme that we've called <emphasis>Ring around the Rosie</emphasis>, no matter what
               specific version. But if you put that name into your browser, you will get back more
               information about that named object.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Familiar, but only in small circles</emphasis>: We will
               need to have names for some of the people who edited the file. Most people who
               contribute to the creation of the data file will not be well-known, public figures.
               If they are, and if they are famous enough to have a Wikipedia entry, then a DBPedia
               IRI could be used. Or if some of the contributors are also published authors, there
               is a good chance that they are listed in the databases of either <link
                  xlink:href="http://viaf.org">VIAF</link> or <link xlink:href="http://isni.org"
                  >ISNI</link>, both of which publish unique IRIs for persons. If we find in those
               systems an IRI for someone who created or helped edit the file, we can use it.</para>
            <para>There is a good chance, however, that many contributors will not be listed in
               these general databases. In these cases, we can assign our own IRI to name these
               participants. We have already done something like this by assigning tag URNs to our
               four transcriptions (the value of <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code> in the rootmost element). We can
               do the same for our editors. If a student Robin Smith has been helping with
               proofreading, we can take an email address for Robin (even one that doesn't work any
               more) and a date when the email was sed and construct a tag URN such as
                  <code>tag:smith.robin@example.com,2012:self</code>. This has a slight drawback in
               that we cannot type this string into our browser to find out more about the Robin,
               but it at least allows us to assign a name that will not be confused as the Robin
               Smith identified by ISNI as <code>http://isni.org/isni/0000000043306406</code>. If we
               wish to go a step further, we could mint a URN from a domain name that we own, and
               set up a linked data service that offers more information, human- and
               computer-readable, about Robin, but this is not required. </para>
            <para>Another example of field-specific IRIs is the concept of relationship between two
               text-bearing objects. We are assuming for the sake of illustration that the version
               published in the 1987 <emphasis>Mother Goose</emphasis> is a direct descendant of the
               1881 version. Our assumption is important to declare, because if we had a different
               view on how one related to the other, it would probably affect the specifics of our
               word-for-word alignments. Because no suitable IRI vocabulary yet exists for such
               concepts, TAN has coined an IRI that can be used by anyone wishing to declare that
               the second of two sources descends from the first through an unknown number of
               intermediaries: <code>tag:textalign.net,2015:bitext-relation:a/x+/b</code>.</para>
            <para>We face a similar issue when thinking about text reuse. We generally consider the
               1987 version to be an adaptation of the 1881 version. And there are not stable,
               well-published IRI vocabularies for text reuse. So we adopt a TAN-coined IRI,
                  <code>tag:textalign.net,2015:reuse-type:adaptation:general</code>.</para>
            <para>For other examples of IRIs coined by TAN, see <link xlink:href="iris.xml"
               />.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Generally unfamiliar</emphasis>: Some things or concepts
               will be unknown to very few people, perhaps only to us. If we plan to refer to that
               thing or concept often, it is preferable to coin a tag URN, as described above. But
               in some cases, we might find that a tag URN we minted for some concept or thing was,
               in hindsight, misleading or poorly constructed, because we hadn't taken into account
               other things that should be named. So if we wish to avoid these kinds of situations,
               we can assign a random IRI called a universally unique identifier (UUID), e.g.,
                  <code>urn:uuid:3fd9cece-b246-4556-b229-48f22a5ae2e0</code>. These uuid URNs, which
               are generated by computers through randomizing functions, are very useful. The
               likelihood that a randomly generated uuid will be identical to any other uuid is
               astronomically improbable, making them reliable, uniquely names for anything (barring
               someone copying and reusing that uuid URN to name some other object or concept).
               Numerous free UUID generators exist, and can be found through Intenet
               searches.</para>
            <para>To humans, a UUID on its own is meaningless, and rather ugly. But it is a good
               start. We always have the option, later, of adding an IRI. It's perfectly fine to
               give one object or concept multiple IRIs. But the reverse is never true. One should
               never use the same IRI to identify more than one object or concept.</para>

            <para>Now that we have explored various IRI vocabularies for concepts around our
               versions of <emphasis>Ring-a-ring-a-roses</emphasis>, we can now complete the
               metadata in our four TAN files. Let us start with the TAN-T file of the 1881
               version:<programlisting>    &lt;head>

            <para>The <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> element is the parent of eight children, all but one
               required in every TAN-T file.</para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-name">&lt;name></link></code> is the human readable form of the <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code> that is
               inside the root element, <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code>. It can be anything. And we can
               supply more than one <code><link linkend="element-name">&lt;name></link></code>, in case we wish to provide it in
               different languages or variations.</para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-master-location">&lt;master-location></link></code> is mandatory only if we have claimed through
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-in-progress">@in-progress</link></code> that the file is no longer in progress. One or more of
               these elements provide URLs where master versions of the file are kept (and updated).
               They may be absolute URLs, such as an address on the Internet, or it may be a
               relative URL, in case we are working exclusively on our local computer. During
               validation, if a file does not match the one in the master version, a warning is
               returned. This allows us to publish a file, make corrections, and notify other users
               without having to keep track of who may be using the file. Similarly, if we are
               working with a copy of a file and it doesn't match the version in the master
               location, a warning will be returned, along with a message or a location of the
               elements that were last changed.</para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-rights-excluding-sources">&lt;rights-excluding-sources></link></code> contains information about rights to
               the data we are releasing. This element has nothing to do with the copyright of the
               source we have used (although, having been published in 1881, the book is clearly in
               the public domain). This once again gets to the TAN metadata principle of describing
               our data and not other things. We have the option to describe the license of the
               source we have used (see the rest of the guidelines for guidance), but we absolutely
               must declare whether we have placed additional scrictures on the dataset we have
               created. In this example, we have released the data under a creative commons license.
               The child element <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> specifies the IRI assigned by Creative
               Commons, and <code><link linkend="element-desc">&lt;desc></link></code> describes it in human-readable format.</para>
            <para>The conjunction of <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> and <code><link linkend="element-desc">&lt;desc></link></code>, the
                  <emphasis>IRI + name pattern</emphasis>, is a recurrent feature of TAN files. We
               may include any number of <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> or <code><link linkend="element-desc">&lt;desc></link></code> elements in
               an IRI + name pattern. But if we do so, we are stating that they all name the same
               thing, not different things.</para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code> points, through its IRI + name pattern, to a computer-
               and human-readable description of the book we have chosen. </para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code> contains data that is specific to the type of TAN
               file in hand, to declare the assumptions we have made in creating the data. In this
               case, because we are working with transcriptions, we have three major components:
                  <code><link linkend="element-work">&lt;work></link></code>, <code><link linkend="element-div-type">&lt;div-type></link></code>, and
                  <code><link linkend="element-recommended-tokenization">&lt;recommended-tokenization></link></code>. </para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-work">&lt;work></link></code> uses the IRI + name pattern to name the work we have chosen
               to transcribe. <code><link linkend="element-div-type">&lt;div-type></link></code> specifies the type of divisions we have
               chosen to use to segment the transcription. In a more complex text, there would be
               several <code><link linkend="element-div-type">&lt;div-type></link></code>s. Each one has an <code><link linkend="attribute-xmlid">@xml:id</link></code>, which
               takes as a value some nickname that we wish to use for <code><link linkend="attribute-type">@type</link></code> values of
                  <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s. <code><link linkend="element-recommended-tokenization">&lt;recommended-tokenization></link></code> specifies a
               pattern recommended for changing the text into word tokens. In the example above, the
                  <code><link linkend="element-recommended-tokenization">&lt;recommended-tokenization></link></code> is empty, and specifies through
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-which">@which</link></code> that a general tokenization pattern should be used, which
               means that word tokens should be created by dividing according to space, and each
               point of punctuation should be treated as a word. Other general options for
                  <code><link linkend="attribute-which">@which</link></code> include <code>general-words-only-1</code> (all punctuation is
               suppressed) and <code>precise-1</code> (tokens should be formed only from spaces or
               U+200B, ZERO WIDTH SPACE). Tokenization also allows the IRI + pattern for customized
               TAN tokenization files (TAN-R-tok), discussed elsewhere in these guidelines.</para>
            <para>The IRI + name pattern is also used for <code><link linkend="element-agent">&lt;agent></link></code>, which describes
               who was involved in creating the data, and <code><link linkend="element-role">&lt;role></link></code>. Any number of
                  <code><link linkend="element-agent">&lt;agent></link></code> and <code><link linkend="element-role">&lt;role></link></code> elements may be included and
               combined as we wish. The <code>agent</code> in this case, Jenny Park, has been given
               a tag URI. The <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> value of <code><link linkend="element-role">&lt;role></link></code> comes from the
               vocabulary of <link xlink:href="http://schema.org">schema.org</link>, which is

               Dublin Core or some other IRI vocabulary describing behaviors, responsibilities, and
               roles.</para>
            <para>Remember that <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> is focused on the data, not its sources, so
               the claim that Jenny Park is the creator pertains only to the data. No inference
               should be made about who created the source. If someone wants that information, or
               anything else about the source, they should pursue the identifier we have provided
               under <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>.</para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-change">&lt;change></link></code> has attributes <code><link linkend="attribute-when">@when</link></code> and <code><link linkend="attribute-who">@who</link></code>
               that specify who made the change/comment and when. The value of <code><link linkend="attribute-when">@when</link></code> is
               always a date plus optional time formatted according to the standard
                  <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> + time (optional).<note>
                  <para>If you are working with an XML editor that supports Schematron Quick Fixes
                     then whenever you are at a <code><link linkend="attribute-when">@when</link></code> or any other attribute that
                     requires an ISO date and the value is malformed you will be given a prompt to
                     insert today's date or date and time in a conformant manner. Using this feature
                     will save you time and effort.</para>
               </note>
               <code><link linkend="attribute-who">@who</link></code> always carries a value that refers to an
               <code>agent/<link linkend="attribute-xmlid">@xml:id</link></code>. Both <code><link linkend="element-change">&lt;change></link></code> (as well as
                  <code><link linkend="element-comment">&lt;comment></link></code>, missing here) lack any IRIs, mainly because the
               likelihood that the data would ever be reused, repeated, or linked to is altogether
               too remote to be make a mandated <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> useful.</para>

   &lt;/head></programlisting></para>
            <para>One significant difference is that <code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code> has a new child,
                  <code><link linkend="element-filter">&lt;filter></link></code>, which contains a <code><link linkend="element-normalization">&lt;normalization></link></code>
               statement that declares, in both a description and an IRI, that we have opted to
               remove word-break line-end hyphenation. This provides a cautionary note to users of
               our data who might value line-end hyphenation. Any number of
                  <code><link linkend="element-normalization">&lt;normalization></link></code>s can be used to describe any alterations we might
               have made in our transcription. In other transcriptions we could use this feature to
               declare other suppressions, such as editorial comments or footnote signals.</para>
            <para>Note that the value of <code>div-type/<link linkend="attribute-xmlid">@xml:id</link></code> here, the letter
                  <code>l</code>, differs from our previous transcription file, <code>line</code>.
               Even though we have adopted a different nickname, they are treated as equivalent
               because in each file we have defined <code>l</code> or <code>line</code> with the
               same IRI, <code>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Line_(poetry)</code>. A computer that
               later aligns these two files will not worry so much about <code>l</code> and
                  <code>line</code>, but will look at the underlying IRI that defines these terms.
               This exemplifies how linked data (see above) can support our work. We are free to use
               abbreviations that make sense to us, yet tie those abbreviations into the larger
               infrastructure by means of IRIs. It also means that our transcriptions can be
               assigned divisions that may be generally rare and unfamiliar or common but only to a
               specific field (e.g., sections of a legal document).</para>
            <para>Our alignment <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>s will look slightly different. We start with
               the TAN-A-div alignment

    &lt;/head></programlisting></para>
            <para>Much of this will look similar to the previous two examples. Every alignment file
               has only one kind of source, namely TAN transcription files, nothing else. Therefore
                  <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>'s <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> always takes the <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code>
               value in the TAN transcription file. <code><link linkend="element-name">&lt;name></link></code> may replicate exactly the
               title found in the transcription file, or it may be modified, perhaps to harmonize
               better with the descriptions of the other texts aligned in the file.
                  <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code> also has an child element not seen in the earlier two
               examples, <code><link linkend="element-location">&lt;location></link></code>, which specifies where the digital file was
               accessed and when (through <code><link linkend="attribute-when-accessed">@when-accessed</link></code>). We may include as many of
               these <code><link linkend="element-location">&lt;location></link></code> elements as we wish (starting with a preferred or
               reliable location). The <code><link linkend="attribute-when-accessed">@when-accessed</link></code> value is important, because if
               the owner of the file later edits it, and provides a date for the change, the
               validator will be able to detect that our alignment file depends upon an older
               version and return a warning with details about the latest change. We can then
               explore the source and see if the alterations merit any changes on our part.</para>
            <para>Our TAN-A-div file could have any number of <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>s, and not
               necessarily for the same work. It also does not matter in which order we put the
                  <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>s. By putting the 1987 or the 1881 version first, we are
               not implying that one is the source of the other. The most important consequence is
               that most processes that use our alignment file will treat the first-listed source as
               the basis from which to compare other sources.</para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code> is empty, mainly because we have, in this case, no
               working assumptions to declare. In more advanced uses, this element would not be
               empty.</para>
            <para>This <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> explains why the <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> of our
               TAN-A-div file could be empty. In the <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> we have already
               specified the texts that would need to be aligned and where they are to be found. All
               TAN-A-div files assume, by default, that every source should be aligned with each
               other upon the basis of <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s, especially leaf
               <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s. That is, the TAN-A-div format assumes all alignments are to
               be made implicitly unless otherwise specified. </para>
            <para>In fact, a TAN-A-div file is in this case technically unnecessary. The two files
               are already predictably structured and aligned, and the works and division types are
               defined identically. But we will see that the options available in a TAN-A-div's
                  <code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code> and <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> will allow us not only
               to deal with inconsistencies in source transcriptions but to create interesting
               alignments that go well beyond the automatic alignment afforded by identically
               structured transcriptions.</para>
            <para>Meanwhile we turn to our fourth file, the TAN-A-tok alignment, whose
                  <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> looks like
               this:<programlisting>    &lt;head>
        &lt;name>token-based alignment of two versions of Ring o Roses&lt;/name>
        &lt;master-location>ringoroses.01+02.token.1.xml&lt;/master-location>

            <para>The TAN-A-tok <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> looks similar to the previous examples,
               except that <code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code> has three children.</para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-bitext-relation">&lt;bitext-relation></link></code> states through an IRI + name pattern the
               stemmatic relationship we think holds between the two sources. (Stemmatics is the
               study of the chain of transmission by which the versions written by authors made
               their way into the copies, versions, and editions that are extant; it frequently
               involves the creation of genealogical-like tree to depict how text-bearing objects
               with different copies of the same text derive from or relate to each other.)</para>
            <para>One or more <code><link linkend="element-reuse-type">&lt;reuse-type></link></code>s specify how one text has reused another.
               The IRI we have used shows that we suspect that the text reuse is general adaptation.
               If this were a translation or a quotation or some other kind of text reuse, we would
               have used a different IRI value.</para>
            <para>A third declaration, <code><link linkend="element-tokenization">&lt;tokenization></link></code>, specifies the tokenization
               pattern we have adopted to define our word tokens. It is much like the
                  <code><link linkend="element-recommended-tokenization">&lt;recommended-tokenization></link></code>s that feature in TAN-T files. Note,
               however, that <code><link linkend="attribute-src">@src</link></code> may take more than one value, to specify that the
               same tokenization rule should be applied to both sources. We could have applied
               different tokenization patterns had we wanted to, either to customized TAN-R-tok
               files or to one of the <code><link linkend="element-recommended-tokenization">&lt;recommended-tokenization></link></code> patterns in the

            <para>It seems clear to us that this 19th-century German version is quite similar to our
               two English versions. We have some alignment options open to us. Two more sets of
               word-for-word alignments would be interesting, but remember, just because we find a
               text that nicely aligns with others does not mean that we <emphasis role="italic"
                  >must</emphasis> align them. In this case, we choose not to worry about word-for
               word alignments, and we focus here only on the TAN-A-div alignment, so that, for
               example, we can later generate an HTML report that will allow us to more conducively
               read the three versions in parallel and study their relationships.</para>
            <para>To that end, we first observe some differences between this transcription and our
               other two. First, the value of <code><link linkend="element-work">&lt;work></link></code> is not the one we have given
               our two versions. Second, the <code><link linkend="element-div-type">&lt;div-type></link></code> is defined as
                  <code>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gedichtzeile</code>. Third, the lines have been
               lettered instead of numbered. And last, the editor seems to have made a typographical
               error, making the last line <code>n="e"</code> instead of <code>n="d"</code>). These
               four differences typify some of the inconsistencies that are found as people work
               independently on similar texts.<note>
                  <para>There are a few other differences in this third transcription that do not
                     affect our alignment. <code><link linkend="element-version">&lt;version></link></code> is used to distinguish
                     different version of the same work found on the same text-bearing object.
                     Notice that the <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> value is a uuid, in this case because the
                     editor was not prepared to deploy a formal IRI naming scheme (perhaps using a
                     tag URN) that would be satisfactory for work-versions.</para>
               </note></para>
            <para>These are points we can easily reconcile in our TAN-A-div file, which we now
               expand to include the German version. We make the following adjustments (in

            <para>The first major change is the insertion of a new <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>,
               identifying the name and location of the third example. Note that two locations have
               been provided, one for the original location and another for the copy saved locally
               into our project folder. Validation will occur at the first document available, so if
               we wanted to work primarily off our local copy, we would have put it first. By
               placing it second, we indicate that we want to have our local copy as a backup, in
               case the first is not available.</para>
            <para>The second major insertion is a new <code><link linkend="element-change">&lt;change></link></code>, documenting when we
               made the alterations. The value of <code><link linkend="attribute-when">@when</link></code> effectively alters the version
               number of our TAN-A-div file.</para>
            <para>The third major change populates the <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> with elements that
               calibrate the new version to the other two. <code><link linkend="element-equate-works">&lt;equate-works></link></code> says that,
               for the sake of this alignment, the works defined in the UK version and the German
               version to be considered equivalent. We did not mention the US version because we do
               not need to. As was mentioned above, anyone using a TAN-A-div should assume that all
               alignments are transitive unless otherwise specified. That includes specifications
               like this. If A and B are already defined to be the same work, and we specify that A
               and C are also the same work, then it must be inferred that B and C are as well.
               Note, we are not committing ourselves to the proposition that they are in reality the
               same work. We are making this statement only provisionally, to facilitate the
               alignment.</para>
            <para><code><link linkend="element-equate-div-types">&lt;equate-div-types></link></code> declares that what the German version calls
               Zeile is, for the sake of this alignment, equivalent to what the UK version calls
               line. Transitivity means that Zeile is inferred to be equivalent to what the US
               version calls <code>l</code>.</para>
            <para>A <code><link linkend="element-realign">&lt;realign></link></code> takes care of the apparent typographical error, this
               time using the US version as the main way to correlate the division references. Any
                  <code><link linkend="element-div-ref">&lt;div-ref></link></code> in a <code><link linkend="element-realign">&lt;realign></link></code> is wrested from automatic
               alignment. If there is an <code><link linkend="element-anchor-div-ref">&lt;anchor-div-ref></link></code> then it will be realigned
               with that reference and, by the law of transitivity, anything that aligns to it, in
               this case the UK version.</para>
            <para>We do not need to reconcile the <code><link linkend="attribute-n">@n</link></code> values of <code>a</code>,
                  <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> in the German version. The TAN format allows
               four numeration systems other than Arabic numerals: Roman numerals (uppercase or
               lowercase), alphabetic numerals (a, b, c, ..., z, aa, bb, ....), and digit-alphabet
               combinations (e.g., 1a, 1e, 4g) or alphabet-digit combinations (e.g., a4, a5, b5).
               All these will be treated as their numerical equivalent.</para>
            <para>With these changes, the new version is completely synchronized with the other two.
               Our work may have been simplified if we had just modified the German version ourself.
               But then we would not have been able to connect our work to other TAN files that may
               be depending upon this version. Perhaps we should have gotten in touch with Hans
               Schmidt, the producer of the German version, and suggest that he modify the version
               to make it align better. In the case of <code><link linkend="element-div-type">&lt;div-type></link></code>, he need merely
               add another line:
                  <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link>http://dbpedia.org/resource/Line_(poetry)&lt;/IRI></code>. This
               line, in addition to the preexisting <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code>, specifies that the two
               IRIs are equivalent. Perhaps he has reasons for labeling the lines with letters, and
               perhaps he is reluctant to explicitly identify this poem with <emphasis role="italic"
                  >Ring around the Rosie</emphasis>. That is within his rights. (Remember, TAN is
               meant to provide a framework within which opinions can be registered, even against
               popular opinion.) But the conversation might lead to our pointing out that
                  <code>n="e"</code> should probably be <code>n="d"</code> and that there is an
               apparent discrepancy in the last line (the original, printed book has the poem twice
               on page 438, one with "Holderbuch," the other, "Holderbusch"). In correcting the
               original transcription and providing a record of the change through
                  <code><link linkend="element-change">&lt;change></link></code>, he tacitly notifies anyone else using the file that
               corrections have been made.</para>
            <para>There is much more to TAN, of course. The rest of these guidelines provide full
               documentation. In addition, other examples in the TAN repository provide ideas on how
               to develop your other alignments, perhaps more complex. The data files in that
               repository are open for modification, copying, reuse, and so forth. Just remember, if
               you do that, be certain to change the tag URN of each TAN file's <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code> so
               that it points to an email address or domain name that you own(ed).</para>

            are best reserved for the next part of this manual. Instead, the focus is on considering

         <section>
            <title>The Big Picture</title>
            <para>The Text Alignment Network is a suite of XML encoding formats. Each TAN format is
               designed for a specific type of textual data, organized in three classes: segmented
               representations of textual works (class 1), annotations of specific texts (class 2),
               and rules for linguistic concepts (Class 3). The number of classes may grow in the
               future to cover claims about text-bearing objects, for example codicology or
               stemmatics (the study of how manuscripts and other versions of a work relate to each
               other).</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Class 1</emphasis>, representations of textual objects,
               consists solely of transcription files. Each transcription file contains the text of
               a single work from a single text-bearing object, whether physical or digital (TAN
               regards digital files as objects). There are two types of transcription file, a
               standard generic format and another for TEI XML files. These two types are
               differentiated by the name of the rootmost element in the file,
                  <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code> and <code>&lt;TEI></code> respectively. In the future,
               class 1 may expand to include formats intended to segment (and therefore align)
               visual, audio, or audiovisual files; it may also expand to include a customized form
               of HTML.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Class 2</emphasis>, annotations of textual representations,
               consists of alignment files and lexico-morphology files. There are two types of
               alignment, one for broad, general alignments and another that focuses on detailed
               specificity. The former, identified by the name <code><link linkend="element-TAN-A-div">&lt;TAN-A-div></link></code> in the
               rootmost element, aligns any number (one or more) of class 1 files. The latter,
                  <code><link linkend="element-TAN-A-tok">&lt;TAN-A-tok></link></code>, aligns only pairs of class 1 files. Lexico-morphology
               files, <code><link linkend="element-TAN-LM">&lt;TAN-LM></link></code>, are used to encode the lexical and morphological (or
               part of speech) forms of individual words in a given class 1 file. In the future,
               class 2 may expand to include syntax (treebanking).</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Class 3</emphasis>, rules for linguistic concepts, consists
               of tokenization patterns and morphological patterns. The first of these,
                  <code><link linkend="element-TAN-R-tok">&lt;TAN-R-tok></link></code>, declares a pattern to be used to transform a string
               of text into a sequence of word tokens for linguistic analysis. The second type,
                  <code><link linkend="element-TAN-R-mor">&lt;TAN-R-mor></link></code>, is used to declare the grammatical categories or
               features of a given language and to stipulate rules for classifying words. Class 3
               file may expand in the future to include transliteration, lexicography, and syntax. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="italic">Dependence and reference</emphasis>: Class 1 files depend
               exclusively upon a single source—some text-bearing object (print or digital); they
               also refer to TAN-R-tok files. Class 2 files alone depend exclusively upon one or
               more class 1 files for their sources. They may also refer to class 3 files. Class 3
               files neither depend upon nor make reference to any other class of TAN file.</para>

               built into the transcriptions themselves. Most TEI and HTML files exhibit in-line
               annotation. Stand-off annotation has been adopted so as to capitalize upon a number

               not be seen as replacements for in-line annotation formats, especially those that set

            <title>Assumptions in the Creation of TAN Data</title>
            <para>All creators and users of TAN files are expected to share few basic
               assumptions.</para>
            <para>First, all TAN-compliant data is to be understood as largely
                  <emphasis>derivative</emphasis>. That is, data files have no originality or
               creativity independent of their sources (but see below about interpretation).
               TAN-compliant data is to be created with intent of adhering as closely as possible to
               some model or archetype. For example, a transcription should replicate faithfully
               some earlier digital edition or text-bearing material object (e.g., stone, papyrus,
               manuscript, printed book for written text; audiovisual media for oral or performative
               texts). Morphological files and alignment files should describe as clearly and as
               reliably as possible their source transcriptions. <emphasis>In creating and
                  publishing a TAN file you claim to have offered a good-faith representation or
                  description of one or more source texts or linguistic concepts; in using a TAN
                  file, you hold the creator to that expectation.</emphasis></para>
            <para>Second, all core TAN files are <emphasis>interpretive</emphasis>. That is, they
               are permeated by editorial assumptions and opinions that might not be shared by
               everyone. If there is any originality or creativity in a TAN file, it is vested in
               the interpretation of the sources. For example, if you edit a transcription file you
               must decide how to handle unusual letterforms and other visible marks. Your decisions
               will be informed by what you think about the original text, its native writing
               system, and how you interpret and use Unicode. If you write an alignment file, you
               must make decisions about what factors caused one text to be transformed into
               another. Lexicomorphological files require you to commit to one or more grammars and
               dictionaries, and you must discern how best to handle cases of vagueness and
               ambiguity. As a general rule, class 2 files have a greater interpretive dimension
               than do class 1 files, and class 3 than class 2. But no matter the degree, no TAN
               data file ever stands completely outside the interpretive act. <emphasis>In creating
                  and publishing a TAN file you claim to have disclosed the principles behind your
                  interpretive outlook; in using a TAN file, you hold the creator to that
                  expectation.</emphasis></para>
            <para>Third, all core TAN files are <emphasis>useful</emphasis>. That is, the
               interpretive impluse is assumed to be coupled with an equally strong desire to make
               the data as useful to as wide a group of users as possible, even those who may not
               share your assumptions or interpretation. For example, a creator of a transcription
               file should normalize and segment texts with a minimum of idiosyncracies, adopting
               when possible reference systems that are widely known so as to optimize the alignment
               process. Morphological files should depend whenever possible upon grammars and lexica
               that are broadly used. Alignment files should work with comprehensible categories of
               text reuse. No TAN file will always be useful to everyone, but it should be as useful
               to as many as possible, as frequently as possible. <emphasis>In creating a TAN file
                  you claim to use common, shared conventions whenever possible, and to note any
                  departures; in using a TAN file, you hold the creator to that
                  expectation.</emphasis></para>
            <para>There are other important assumptions that can and should be declared in a TAN
               file, and they are addressed in later chapters of these guidelines.</para>

         <section>
            <title>Core Technology</title>
            <para>TAN depends upon a core set of basic, relatively stable technologies, discussed
               below. The technology and associated key acronyms or terms are very briefly defined
               and explained, to orient you to the concept, terminology, and conventions. References
               to further reading will lead you to better and more thorough introductions. The
               central goal of this section is to document and explain how certain aspects of each
               technology have affected the design of TAN, and therefore may significantly affect
               creating or processing TAN-compliant data.</para>
            <section xml:id="unicode">
               <title>Unicode</title>
               <para>Unicode is the worldwide standard for the consistent encoding, representation,
                  and exchange of digital texts. The standard, stable but still growing, is intended
                  to represent all the world's writing systems, living and historical. Maintained by
                  a nonprofit organization, Unicode is the basis upon which we can create and edit
                  text in mixed alphabets and reliably share that data with other people,
                  independent of specific fonts. Any Unicode-compliant text is (in general)
                  semantically interoperable on the character level and can be exchanged between
                  users and systems, no matter what font might be used to display the text. If some
                  software tries to display some Unicode-compliant text in a particular font that
                  does not support a particular alphabet, and ends up displaying boxes, the
                  underlying data is still intact and valid. Styling the text with a font that does
                  support the alphabet will reveal this to be the case.</para>
               <para>With more than 110,000 characters, Unicode is almost as complex as human
                  writing itself, and so has required a system of organization. The entire sequence
                  of characters is divided into Unicode blocks, each one reserved, more or less, for
                  a particular alphabet. Within each block, the various characters may be grouped
                  further. Each character is assigned a single codepoint.</para>
               <para>Because computers work on the binary system, it was considered ideal to number
                  the characters or glyphs in Unicode with a related numeration system. Codepoints
                  are therefore numbered according to a hexadecimal system (base 16), which is
                  larger than our most common system, the decimal (base 10). The hexadecimal system
                  uses the digits 0 through 9 and the letters A through F. (The number 10 in decimal
                  is A in hexadecimal; decimal 11 = hex B; decimal 17 = hex 10; decimal 79 = hex
                  4F.) To find Unicode codepoint values is therefore helpful to think of the corpus
                  of glyphs as a very long ribbon sixteen squares wide. This is illustrated nicely
                     <link
                     xlink:href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Unicode/Character_reference/0000-0FFF"
                     >in this article</link>. Each position along the width is labeled with a
                  hexadecimal number (0-9, A-F) that always identifies the last digit of a
                  character's code point value.</para>
               <para>It is common to refer to Unicode characters by their value or their name. The
                  value customarily starts "U+" and continues with the hexadecimal value, usually at
                  least four digits. The official Unicode name is usually given fully in uppercase.

                     <para>At the core level of conformance, Unicode does not dictate whether
                        combining characters (accents, modifying symbols) should be counted
                        independently or as part of a base character, nor does the family of XML
                        languages. This affects regular expressions and XPath expressions. Any class
                        2 TAN file that attempts to count characters in a string of text that
                        includes combining characters will trigger a warning. In the TAN format,
                        character counting is made exclusively of non-combining characters, strictly
                        defined as the regular expression <code>[^\p{M}]</code>. Any statement made

               <title>eXtensible Markup Language (XML)</title>
               <para>The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a machine-actionable markup language
                  that facilitates human readability. Defined by the W3C, XML has two versions, 1.0
                  and 1.1. &lt;<emphasis role="bold">Q: should version 1.1 be allowed or
                     mandated?</emphasis>></para>
               <para>At its heart, XML is rather simple. It begins with an opening line that
                  declares that what otherwise would look just like plain text is an XML file. It
                  then proceeds to the data, which must marked by one or more pairs of tags. An
                  opening tag looks like <code>&lt;tag></code> and a closing like
                     <code>&lt;/tag></code> (or if the tags contain no data, this can be collapsed
                  into one: <code>&lt;tag/></code>). Each pair of tags is called an element.
                  Elements must nest within each other. They cannot overlap. For
                  example:<programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;p>A paragraph about 
    &lt;name>&lt;first>Mary&lt;/first> 
        &lt;last>Lee&lt;/last>&lt;/name>.&lt;/p></programlisting></para>
               <para>This nesting relationship of elements means that an XML document can be thought
                  of as a tree or genealogy, which serves as the basis of technical vocabulary that
                  describes the relationship between elements: root, parent, child, sibling,
                  ancestor, and descendant. In the example above, the root element
                     <code>&lt;p></code> is the parent of <code>&lt;name></code> and the ancestor of
                     <code>&lt;name></code>, <code>&lt;first></code>, and <code>&lt;last></code>.
                  The element <code>&lt;first></code> is a child of <code>&lt;name></code> and a
                  descendant of both &lt;name> and <code>&lt;p></code>. <code>&lt;first></code> and
                     <code>&lt;last></code> are siblings to each other.</para>
               <para>The opening tag of an element might have additional nodes called attributes,
                  recognized by a word, an equals sign, and then some text within quotation marks
                  (single or double). An element may have many attributes, and those attributes can
                  appear in any order. Attributes can be thought of as leaves on an XML tree. They
                  are intended to carry simple data (usually metadata about the data contained by
                  the element), because they cannot govern a hierarchy.</para>
               <programlisting>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

               <para>The two examples above provide the same text with different line breaks, but
                  they are functionally equivalent. That is because in most XML projects extra
                  lines, spaces, and indentation are allowed so that a document's layout can show
                  more clearly, through indented space, how elements nest within each other.
                  Continuous strings of multiple spaces, tabs, and newline/carriage return are to be
                  treated as a single space. (This behavior can be overridden in XML, but TAN files
                  always assume that a string and its space-normalized form are equivalent.)</para>
               <para>XML allows for other rules to be added, if an individual or group so wishes.
                  These rules, called schemas, can allow great flexibility or be very strict. The
                  TAN schemas tend to the latter. This is true also of its customization of the TEI
                  schemas. For more about the strictures placed upon the TEI All schema see <xref
                     linkend="tan-tei"/>. See also <xref linkend="class_common"/> and <xref
                     linkend="class_1"/>.</para>
               <para>TAN-TEI schemas are generated on the basis of the official TEI All schema that

                     <para>By default, XML treats multiple instances of space characters (space,
                        tab, newline, and carriage return) as a single space. If retention of
                        multiple spaces is important for your research, then the TAN formats are not
                        an appropriate XML format, because it always assumes space normalization.
                        TAN is not intended to replicate the appearance of a text-bearing object.
                        Any project that has this as a requirement should not use the TAN
                        format.</para>

                        have their space normalized. This will be applied to the concatenation of
                        all text() descendants. This is important in transcriptions. If any amount

                              >&lt;div></link></code>s, it is assumed that there is some amount of
                        white space between them. If a word straddles <code><link
                              linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s, there should be no

               <para>XML allow users to develop vocabularies of elements as they wish. One person
                  may wish to use <code>&lt;bank></code> to refer to a financial institution,
                  another to a river. XML was designed to allow users to mix vocabularies, even when
                  those vocabularies use synonymous element names. This means that anyone using
                     <code>&lt;bank></code> as an element name must be able to specify exactly whose
                  vocabulary of <code>&lt;bank></code> is intended. Disambiguation is accomplished
                  by associating IRIs (see <xref linkend="IRIs_and_linked_data"/> below) with the
                  element names. The actual full name of an element is the joined IRI and element
                  name, e.g., <code>http://example1.com/terms/bank</code> and
                     <code>http://example2.com/terms/bank</code>. </para>
               <para>This approach to disambiguation is effective but it requires some way to
                  associate the element name with its base IRI. If only one vocabulary is in play,
                  then the base IRI can be declared to be the default
                  <emphasis>namespace</emphasis>, which means that any subsequent element should be
                  treated as being the <emphasis>local name</emphasis> of an element that is part of
                  that namespace. The namespace is much like a surname (family name) and the local
                  name, a given name of a person in that family. If a simple, small genealogical
                  tree is said to belong to the Smith family, then the name "Smith" need appear only
                  at the head, not at every person named on that tree.</para>
               <para>But just as genalogical trees that involve other families require
                  disambiguation, so too do XML files that mix vocabularies. But where a
                  genealogical tree can simply add the family names at every node, XML has opted for
                  a different mechanism, that of the <emphasis>prefix</emphasis>, a short string
                  that is associated with the namespace, and is then attached to the element name. </para>
               <para>For example, the TAN namespace is <emphasis role="bold"
                        ><code>tag:textalign.net,2015:ns</code></emphasis>. The recommended prefix
                  is <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis>tan</emphasis></emphasis>. It is customary,
                  then, when TAN elements are mixed with other elements such as TEI, to use the
                  prefix to disambiguate them, e.g., <code>&lt;tan:div></code> versus
                     <code>&lt;tei:div></code>. The fully qualified name of
                     <code>&lt;tei:div></code> is properly
                     <code>http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0/div</code>, whereas <code>&lt;tan:div></code>
                  is <code>tag:textalign.net,2015:ns/div</code>. </para>
               <para>Any XML element may take a special attribute (actually a pseudo-attribute,
                  since it is technically not an attribute), <code>@xmlns</code>, sometimes on its
                  own and sometimes followed by a colon and a prefix. The first case is used to
                  declare the default namespace (and therefore sidestep the need to use a prefix).
                  The second case is used to bind a namespace to a prefix. These definitions apply
                  not only to the element that contains the <code>@xmlns</code> attribute but to all
                  descendants, unless overridden. </para>
               <para>
                  <caution>
                     <para>There are no plans to change the namespace. But if, in the future
                        development of the network, it becomes clear that one or more elements must
                        be redefined in manner incompatible with previous definitions, then the
                        namespace will be changed as well. Such a change will coincide with a major
                        version update of the schemas (see <xref linkend="schemas_and_validation"
                        />).</para>
                  </caution>
               </para>
               <para>The examples and the validation files illustrate the use of the TAN namespace.
                  See especially those files pertaining to class 1 and TAN-TEI files, where the TEI
                  and TAN vocabularies mix.</para>
               <para>The TAN namespace uses a tag URN instead of an <code>http://</code> IRI for
                  several reasons: (1) http namespaces rarely resolve as a URL to anything useful;
                  (2) tag URN reinforces the lesson that the namespace is a name and not a location;
                  (3) tag URNs are naturally constructed to allow versioning (see note above); (4)
                  should the domain name <code>textalign.net</code> come under the ownership of
                  someone else, the namespace will still remain valid because it is tied to a date
                  when that domain was owned; http-prefixed namespaces are in jeopardy of being
                  rendered invalid when a domain name changes ownership.</para>

                        sometimes supplemented with a hyphen and a script or regional subtag. For
                        example, <code>eng</code>, <code>eng-UK</code>, and
                           <code>eng-UK-Cyrl</code> refer, respectively, to English generally,

                  coin and use URN names that take the form of URLs. The URL then allows one both to

                           names according to URLs is inadequate for long-term use, since it has no

                           In the semantic web, conflation of name with a location to resolve it is
                           considered a virtue because a single string answers two questions: what
                           is the resource and where can I find out more about it. But this
                           conflation is unhelpful for those who use the TAN formats, who are
                           encouraged to distribute their TAN files widely, and not rely upon a
                           single location. And URLs are in common parlance interpreted as locations
                           for data, not as names for things. TAN-compliant tag URLs ensure that the
                           names of concepts and objects do not look like locations, maintaining a
                           distinction that has always been a foundational principle in scholarly
                           citation, namely, that one should always distinguish the name of a

                     <para>Tag URNs are used as the IRI name for TAN files for a number of reasons,
                        foremost of which are their suitability for enduring naming schemes. That
                        is, they will remain valid centuries from now, long after the death of the
                        owner of a domain names or email address. It is essential to familiarize
                        yourself with this simple but powerful IRI system.</para>
                     <para>Great care must be taken in choosing the IRI name, because you are the
                        sole guarantor of its uniqueness. <emphasis role="italic">It is permissible
                           for something to have multiple IRIs, but never acceptable for a IRI to
                           name more than one thing.</emphasis> It is a good practice to keep a
                        master checklist of IRI names you have created. If you find yourself
                        forgetting, or think you run the risk of creating duplicate IRI names, you
                        should start afresh by creating a new namespace for your tag URNs. That is,
                        if <code>tag:textalign.net,2015:...</code> seems to be overly cluttered, you
                        may start a new set of names with something else, e.g.,
                           <code>tag:textalign.net,2015-01-02:...</code>.</para>

                  <para>Regular expressions come in many different flavors, and each one deals with
                     some of the more complex issues in Unicode in their own manners. This ambiguity
                     will be most keenly felt in the use of combining characters in Unicode. Given a
                     string <code>&amp;#x61;&amp;#x301;&amp;#x62;</code> = áb, a search pattern
                        <code>a.</code> will in some search engines include the b and others will
                     not.</para>
                  <para>Unicode has differentiated three levels of support for regular expressions
                     (see <link xlink:href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/">official
                        report</link>). Only level one conformance in TAN is guaranteed. If you find
                     the need to count characters, and you are working with a language that uses
                     combining characters, you should use count only base characters, not combining
                     ones. See <xref linkend="combining_characters"/>. Further, any regular
                     expressions with wildcard characters cannot be expected to be treated
                     uniformly.</para>

               <para>Both humans and computers will need to read and write TAN metadata. Very often
                  what is readable to humans is unreadable to computers, and vice versa. So the TAN
                  format requires that all metadata be provided in both forms. Although this rule
                  may appear to introduce redundancy and therefore new opportunities for error, the
                  clarity is critical. It is the only way at present to ensure that anyone who
                  approaches the data--computer or human--can parse and use it. And, in reality,
                  doubly expressed metadata provides a safeguard much like a checksum: the human-
                  and computer-readable descriptions should correspond. Any discrepancy is a signal
                  that an error should be diagnosed and fixed.</para>
               <para>Some metadata, such as comments, are neither easily nor profitably translated
                  into a computer-actionable string. In such cases only the human-readable form is
                  required. Other metadata use regular expressions or ISO-compliant dates, both of
                  which are well formed and usually human-legible. In those cases the human- and
                  computer-readable components are not separated. In cases where a datum is not
                  understandable to humans, such as a complex regular expression, a <code><link
                        linkend="element-comment">&lt;comment></link></code> may be provided.</para>
               <para>Those exceptions aside, all other metadata takes what is called the <emphasis

                  of a tag URN (see <xref linkend="tag_urn"/> for syntax). The IRI name, which is

               <para>In choosing a value of <code><link linkend="attribute-id">@id</link></code> you

                  but you do not have to. Indeed, it may not be a good idea, since files are
                  frequently renamed, often with good reason. A TAN file's IRI name should rarely if
                  ever change, especially after publishing it, because others will be citing it by
                  the IRI name. </para>

                  you falsely suggest that the owner of that namespace is responsible for the
                  revised file. In these cases, you should supply a <code><link

               <para>The IRI name points to an edition but not a version. The specific version of a

                     >@ed-when</link></code> that has the latest date. It is important, therefore,
                  whenever you change a TAN file that has already been published to provide at least
                  an edit stamp (<xref linkend="edit_stamp"/>) in the part of the file you changed

                        <code><link linkend="element-change">&lt;change></link></code>. In so doing,
                  when anyone editing a TAN file dependent upon yours validates the file, they will
                  get a warning that changes have been made. The user may then either continue to
                  process the file (if the changes are minor, there may be no problem) or
                  investigate the changes before deciding what to do. </para>

            <para>To answer these questions completely, consistently, and predictably the
                     <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>, a mandatory child
               of the rootmost element, takes a common pattern across <emphasis>all</emphasis> TAN
               formats, thus allowing anyone (people or computers) to work easily and predictably
               across large numbers and types of TAN files. The TAN <code><link
                     linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>, intended to be concise and
               focused, compels you to provide metadata for the data that is governed by <code><link
                     linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>, but it does not require
               metadata for the metadata. That is, your metadata should focus on the data itself and
               not other things. For example, <code><link linkend="element-head"
                  >&lt;head></link></code> requires you name the people who helped create or edit
               the data, but you are not expected to give those person's birthdays, nationality,
               etc. You merely refer through <code><link linkend="element-IRI"
                  >&lt;IRI></link></code> to other authoritative sources that can provide more
               information about that person.</para>
            <para>A detailed description of <code><link linkend="element-head"
                  >&lt;head></link></code> is provided, but here is a summary. </para>
            <para>To describe the current file, <code><link linkend="element-head"
                  >&lt;head></link></code> takes one or more <code><link linkend="element-name"
                     >&lt;name></link></code>s, zero or more <code><link linkend="element-desc"
                     >&lt;desc></link></code>s and <code><link linkend="element-master-location"
                     >&lt;master-location></link></code>s, and one <code><link

                  >&lt;rights-excluding-sources></link></code>.</para>
            <para>Next come a list of dependencies: zero or more <code><link
                     linkend="element-inclusion">&lt;inclusion></link></code>s, one or more
                     <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>s, and zero or
               more <code><link linkend="element-see-also">&lt;see-also></link></code>s.</para>
            <para>All editorial assumptions are placed in <code><link linkend="element-declarations"
                     >&lt;declarations></link></code>, which differs widely in structure from one
               TAN format to the next.</para>
            <para>Finally comes the section that states who did what when: one or more <code><link linkend="element-agent">&lt;agent></link></code>s,
               <code><link linkend="element-role">&lt;role></link></code>s, and <code><link linkend="element-change">&lt;change></link></code>s, and zero or more <code><link linkend="element-agentrole">&lt;agentrole></link></code>s.</para>
            <para>Detailed descriptions about these elemnets are found in the links above. The rest
               of this section deals with broader issues relevant to constructing metadata.</para>
            <section xml:id="license">
               <title>Rights and Licenses</title>
               <para>Two TAN elements cover rights and licenses: <code><link
                        linkend="element-rights-excluding-sources"
                        >&lt;rights-excluding-sources></link></code> (mandatory in every TAN file)
                  and <code><link linkend="element-rights-source-only"
                        >&lt;rights-source-only></link></code> (optional, and never allowed in class
                  2 files, because the sources—TAN files—always have statements of rights). </para>
               <para>The distinction is made because it is much easier to think about the rights and
                  license behind your own work than others'. Declaring the who holds what rights
                  over your source(s) may be more difficult, perhaps even risky, and is therefore
                  optional (see below).</para>
               <para>As an editor, you are strongly encouraged in the <code><link linkend="element-desc">&lt;desc></link></code> element
                  of <code><link linkend="element-rights-excluding-sources">&lt;rights-excluding-sources></link></code> to emphasize the distinction between
                  the rights you have over your data and the rights held by others over your source.
                  A statement something like this is recommended: <code><link linkend="element-desc">&lt;desc></link>The data in this
                     file, only insofar as it constitutes an independent work, is licensed exclusive
                     of any licenses held by parties over the source or sources listed
                     below.&lt;/desc></code></para>
               <para>If you find a discrepancy between the two licenses--that of a TAN file and that
                  of its sources--the more restrictive license should be respected. In using a TAN
                  file, it is your responsibility to investigate the entire chain of rights. If a
                  TAN user declares a very liberal, open license for the data, this does not
                  necessarily mean that the material upon which it depends is in the public domain.
                  The source may be under tightly regulated rights.</para>
               <para>It is recommended that you not declare who own what rights over your source
                  unless you yourself are the rightsholder or unless you can make this assertion
                  with certainty. Copyright laws differ from one country to another, and they have
                  changed over time. A source may be protected by copyright in one place and
                  simultaneously be in the public domain in another. (For example, neither the U.S.
                  nor Canada have explicit provisions about the copyright status of modern editions
                  of ancient texts; Germany, however, explicitly allows forty years of copyright
                  protection before the text goes into the public domain.) Some copyright statements
                  in books are false, or cannot be proven. Some persons or entities who claim rights
                  over a source may have no legal basis for the claim, at least in some
                  jurisdictions. Furthermore, if you mischaracterize the rights that are held over a
                  source, you may be held liable by a putative rights holder. It is safer to use the
                        <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> of <code><link
                        linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code> (described below) to
                  point the user to authorities that have greater authority and specificity about
                  who owns what rights. </para>
               <para>If you know that a source is in the public domain, it is recommended that you
                  use the IRI <code>http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/</code> and
                  omit <code><link linkend="attribute-rights-holder">@rights-holder</link></code>.
                  If you know the rights holder of a source has waived all rights and placed the
                  work in the public domain, you may use the IRI
                     <code>https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/</code>.</para>

               <para>Many if not most TAN files are created alongside or in close connection with
                  other files that are shared by a single project or provider. Many of these related
                  files will repeat information found in the others. Such repetition opens up the
                  possibility of discrepancies in the course of editing. To avoid duplication and to
                  minimize the problems inherent in incomplete editing, the
                     <code><link linkend="element-inclusion">&lt;inclusion></link></code> element is provided. This element points to any TAN
                  file that is a candidate for including in the parent file.</para>
               <para>An <code><link linkend="element-inclusion">&lt;inclusion></link></code> does
                  nothing on its own. It merely indicates a file that may be used for patterned
                  inclusions. It is made effective through other parts of the file, where
                        <code><link linkend="attribute-include">@include</link></code> is used in an
                  empty element to point to the <code><link linkend="attribute-xmlid"
                     >@xml:id</link></code> of an <code><link linkend="element-inclusion"
                        >&lt;inclusion></link></code>. This effectively tells every TAN-compliant
                  processor to retrieve every element of that type from the file indicated by the
                        <code><link linkend="element-inclusion">&lt;inclusion></link></code> and
                  insert it in that place in the host file, eliminating duplications.</para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-inclusion">&lt;inclusion></link></code>s are very
                  important, as important as <code><link linkend="element-source"
                     >&lt;source></link></code>s (see below). If an <code><link
                        linkend="element-inclusion">&lt;inclusion></link></code> cannot be located,
                  it will be treated as a fatal error during validation. Because of the importance
                  of access to included files, it is strongly recommended that inclusions be limited
                  to a specific collection, and that only local URLs be used. It is not advisable to
                  depend upon a file in a different collection for inclusion, </para>
               <para>Inclusions are recursive. For a file A with an element <code>&lt;x
                     include='B'></code> a processor will include every <code>&lt;x></code> found in
                  file B and B's inclusions for that element. Inclusions performed on an element may
                  not be circular. It is perfectly legal, however, for two files to use each other
                  as inclusions for different elements. </para>
               <para>In fact, in a collection that relies upon inclusions, it is a good strategy to
                  distinguish between inclusions in the <code><link linkend="element-head"
                        >&lt;head></link></code> and those for the <code><link
                        linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> and to create reciprocal
                  inclusions. One file might be used as the principal place for metadata related to
                  the project, and given a special filename to easily distinguish it (perhaps by
                  putting the file in all caps). All other files might point to it for their
                  metadata. In turn, that key metadata file might draw from other dependent files
                  for its body.</para>

               <para>Creating and editing a TAN file almost always involves working with previous
                  digital files. There will be times where it is unclear whether to credit those

                        <code><link linkend="element-see-also">&lt;see-also></link></code>, and if
                  the latter, what type.</para>
               <para>The first step is to determine <code><link linkend="element-source"
                        >&lt;source></link></code>s. For class 2 TAN files, this is rather clear:
                  only other class 1 TAN files. But the situation can get nebulous with class 1
                  files, which are representations of textual objects. A digital transcription might
                  start off as a <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>, but
                  as editing proceeds, you might find that the work is reflecting the source of your
                  source. It is almost always better to go up the chain of dependence until you find
                  the earliest version that still meets your needs. Make that your <code><link
                        linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>. You can then make the
                  third-party digital transcription a <code><link linkend="element-see-also"
                        >&lt;see-also></link></code>. In crediting the third party, you do not
                  assign them any rights. But beware, lest any agreement you have made puts you in
                  violation of contract law (see <xref linkend="license"/>).</para>
               <para>The ambiguity can be even more pronounced in class 3 files, which represent
                  rather abstract entities: grammars and tokenization patterns, for which reason
                        <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code> is

               <para>Each TAN format has been designed to limit inheritable attributes to the most

                  perspective of computability, there is no reason to restrict the number of
                  inheritable attributes; from a human perspective there is, because each new

         <title>Class 1 TAN Files, Representations of Textual Objects</title>
         <para>Class 1 TAN files preserve segmented representations of textual objects. This class
            consists solely of transcriptions, the foundation of any TAN-compliant project. No class
            2 files (e.g., alignment, morphology) can be created without class 1 files. </para>
         <para>Transcriptions come in two different formats, identified by the rootmost element.
                  <code><link linkend="element-TAN-T">&lt;TAN-T></link></code> is a simple, generic
            format, as close as one can get to plain text. <code>&lt;TEI></code> (also referred to in this manual as TAN-TEI), on the other
            hand, is highly expressive. Because the two types function almost identically, the
            generic TAN-T format is described first, followed by a supplementary discussion
            pertaining to TAN-TEI.</para>

            <title>Principles and Assumptions</title>
            <section>
               <title>General</title>
               <para>To maximize the utility of transcriptions within the TAN ecosystem, certain
                  assumptions and recommendations are made regarding transcriptions, complementing
                  the more general ones (see <xref linkend="design_principles"/>).</para>
               <para>First, TAN transcription files are restricted exclusively to the creation of an
                  accurate digital representation of a single version of a single work, correctly
                  segmented and labeled and coming from only one source, a text-bearing object.
                  Editors of TAN-T or TAN-TEI files should be able to read, write, and proofread
                  texts in the languages of the sources. They should understand the texts well
                  enough to segment them and label them according to the conventions used for those
                  works. They should be familiar with normalizing conventions for texts from the
                  period, language, and culture. They should have some familiarity with how users of
                  the text will distinguish and count words.</para>
               <para>Editors need not understand everything about their texts, and they need not
                  have any specialized skill in grammar or lexicology. They need not know the
                  morphology of individual words, or how individual parts of the text have been
                  translated. Those skills are reserved for other core TAN formats. </para>
               <para>TAN-T(EI) editors stand at the beginning of a larger workflow for text
                  alignment. It is critical that work not be published hastily, and only after
                  careful proofreading, especially of white-space. Many transcriptions, especially
                  those of long texts, have typographical errors. Eliminating as many as possible
                  before publication will maximize the utility of a TAN-T(EI) file.</para>
               <para>If you are creating a TAN-T(EI) file, you are doing so primarily to service
                  text alignment. To align is to correlate passages of text that attest to acts of
                  text reuse, e.g., translating, paraphrasing, revising, quoting, and summarizing.
                  Common to all these processes is that one or more texts, usually called the
                     <emphasis>source</emphasis> (or <emphasis>sources</emphasis>), serves as the
                  basis for a new text, oftentimes called the <emphasis>target</emphasis>. The
                  target may bear little resemblance to its sources. Translators, whether working
                  literally or freely, move from idea to idea, clause to clause, sentence to
                  sentence, and word to word. Line and page breaks in a source usually leave
                  negligible if any trace in the target. Therefore a TAN transcription file should
                  not try to reflect the appearance of its source (i.e., it should not be a
                  diplomatic edition), and it should be structured, when possible, by the most
                  familiar reference system for that work. If possible, semantic mileposts (clauses,
                  sentences, paragraphs, chapters) not visual (lines, columns, pages, volumes)
                  should be preferred (see below on <link linkend="reference_system">reference
                     systems</link>).</para>
               <para>Contributors and users of TAN files also assume a fundamental distinction
                  between a textual object (or a text-bearing object) and a conceptual work. The
                  former has materiality and the latter does not. Even though both are
                  constitutively necessary for any transcription, the two are sharply differentiated
                  in the TAN format. For example, when we refer in ordinary conversation to the
                     <emphasis>Odyssey</emphasis> we refer to an ideal, conceptual, or model
                  narrative/poem but not to a particular copy, version, or edition. On the other
                  hand, if we encounter a book with <emphasis>The Odyssey</emphasis> on the cover,
                  we do not necessarily assume that it matches the ideal concept of the
                     <emphasis>Odyssey</emphasis>. It might contain only parts of it, or it might
                  include other works, or it might be a very loose rendition. In ordinary
                  conversation, we usually indicate whether our use of "Odyssey" refers to the work
                  or to a specific copy.</para>

            <section xml:id="domain_model">
               <title>Domain model</title>
               <para>The categories used to describe parts of class 1 files may remind some readers
                  of the domain model defined by the Functional Requirements for Bibliographical
                  Records (FRBR), which identifies four types of entities for what they call Group 1
                  (Products of intellectual &amp; artistic endeavor): <emphasis>Work</emphasis>,
                     <emphasis>Expression</emphasis>, <emphasis>Manifestation</emphasis>, and
                     <emphasis>Item</emphasis>, the first pair being conceptual, non-material
                  entities and the latter pair material ones. </para>
               <para>The TAN encoding format currently does not have a published domain model, but
                  if it did, it would reveal a slightly different perspective. FRBR Items are
                  equivalent to what TAN calls <emphasis>objects</emphasis> (a term chosen to
                  emphasize their materiality). Multiple objects that for all intents and purposes
                  are indistinguishable (i.e., items reproduced mechanically) are equivalent to FRBR
                  Manifestations, but in TAN no separate entity has been defined. It is best to
                  think of TAN objects as being equivalent to FRBR Items, with FRBR Manifestations
                  being sets of indistinguishable TAN objects. </para>
               <para>As for conceptual entities, TAN has been designed with the assumption that most
                  users will find the distinction between Works and Expressions to be unhelpful or
                  false. What one person calls a FRBR Expression another may legitimately call a
                  Work. TAN assumes that any derivation of a Work (or Works) is itself a Work, which
                  is really shorthand for <emphasis role="italic">work-version</emphasis>. Thus, in
                  this manual the term <emphasis>version</emphasis> indicates not an entity separate
                  from a work, but rather a work that is known either to derive from another work or
                  to be the basis for other versions of a work. </para>
               <para>TAN avoids altogether the term <emphasis>Expression</emphasis>, which implies a
                  medium, without which nothing can be expressed, and therefore materiality. </para>
            </section>
            <section>
               <title>One version, one work, one object, one reference system</title>
               <para><emphasis>Every TAN-T(EI) file must be restricted to a transcription of a
                     single version of a single conceptual work found on a single text-bearing
                     object, segmented and labeled according to a single reference
                  system</emphasis>. </para>
               <para>This restrictive principle is critical to the the success of the network. It
                  reduces the risk of confusion, simplifies the files, and shifts markup complexity
                  from an individual transcription file to the network in which that file
                  participates.</para>
               <section xml:id="textual_objects">
                  <title>One textual object</title>
                  <para>Each TAN-T(EI) file transcribes one and only one text-bearing, or textual,
                     object. It may be a digital file or a particular book, manuscript, stone,
                     label, and so forth. If the object you've chosen has been made mechanically and
                     is virtually indistinguishable from other objects created in the same process
                     (e.g., copies of a printed book or copies of a digital file), then the entire
                     set of copies is to be treated as a single object (an entity some librarians
                     call a manifestation). </para>
                  <para>Some cases about what constitutes an object will not be clear, and will
                     require discernment and judgment on your part. For example, some manuscripts
                     have been split up, their parts now residing in multiple libraries around the
                     world; other manuscripts have been physically altered or supplemented. In such
                     cases, you may need to define your single text-bearing object in a way that
                     might not match the way others define it. But the decision is your prerogative,
                     not theirs. You have both the right and responsibility to define your object in
                     the way that you think will most benefit users of your files.</para>
                  <para>It is a good idea, when naming your textual object in <code><link
                           linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>, with an <code><link
                           linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> value the form of an
                        <code>http</code> URL provided by a library catalogue. This way you provide
                     a way for human or computers to retrieve extensive, structured bibliographical
                     information. You also save yourself the hassle of writing a detailed
                     bibliographical description that your users would have to tailor for inclusion
                     into their reference management system. If a URL cannot be found for
                           <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> (perhaps the
                     text-bearing object is a papyrus or a T-shirt), you may simply coin a tag URN
                     or a UUID. Alternatively, if you find another TAN file that uses the same
                     source, it would be a good idea to adopt that name.</para>

                  <para>Every TAN transcription must be segmented into a hierarchy of uniquely
                     labeled divisions, defined in the <code><link linkend="element-body"
                           >&lt;body></link></code> through <code><link linkend="element-div"

                        >@n</link></code> values. </para>
                  <para>Those divisions, whenever possible, should align with the reference system
                     that prevails for the work across versions or translations, a so-called
                     canonical reference system. (Because the canonicity of a reference system
                     admits degrees and dispute, the simpler term <emphasis role="italic">reference
                        system</emphasis> is adopted, and applies to all textual labeling systems,
                     whether "canonical" or not.) </para>
                  <para>If you have your choice, preference should be shown to systems that follow
                     the semantic contours of the work, not the physical features of a particular
                     object. Chapter, paragraph, and sentence numbers are preferable to volume,
                     page, and line numbers, because other versions of the work (e.g., translations,
                     paraphrases) will only roughly, if at all, follow an object-oriented reference
                     system. </para>
                  <para>Sometimes an object-based reference system is inescapable, or is the most
                     common reference system for a work. It is perfectly acceptable to adopt that
                     scheme, but it may prove, down the line, to be more work during the alignment
                     process. There are ways of minimizing the work involved in coordinating a
                     transcription with an object-based reference system native to another version,
                     discussed in a separate part of these guidelines [XREF PENDING].</para>
                  <para>If a given work has multiple systems (e.g., the works of Plato and
                     Aristotle, which have both semantic- and object-oriented reference systems),
                     then you may wish to provide two files per transcription, placing in each file
                     a <code><link linkend="element-see-also">&lt;see-also></link></code> pointing
                     to the other and a <code><link linkend="element-relationship"
                           >&lt;relationship></link></code> with the keyword <code>alternatively
                        divided edition</code> as content. A pair of alternatively divided editions
                     can usefully serve as the basis for concordances.</para>
                  <para>If there is a good reference system, but the divisions are overly lengthy,
                     you may introduce subdivisions. Such subdivided texts will still support
                     references to the older system. One drawback is that leaf divs shift from the
                     older to the new subdivision system. Elements from class 2 files that require
                     references to point to leaf divs will need to use the new system. There is also
                     no guarantee that the provisional subdivisions you introduce will be adopted by
                     other editors who create or edit TAN versions of the same work.</para>
                  <para>If there is no reference system, or if you think that the ones that exist
                     are inadequate or misguided, you may create one of your own. If you develop
                     your own reference system, be sure to make it useful and consistent, not just
                     for your version but for any others of the same work. All references must be
                     unique, and they must conform to a hierarchical model. Like XML itself, a
                     reference system must follow a treelike hierarchy: one-to-many relationships
                     from the root element down, with no overlapping siblings. </para>

                     a word or abbreviation, this will be interpreted as a Roman numeral only if the

                           <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> type match the

               <title>Preparing transcriptions for tokenization</title>
               <para>The previous sections describe segmentation that applies to phrases and larger
                  portions of text. But you must give thought to how your transcription will be used
                  for token- or word-based segmentation (see <xref linkend="tan-r-tok"/>). You will
                  make recommendations on tokenization in one or more <code><link
                        linkend="element-recommended-tokenization"
                        >&lt;recommended-tokenization></link></code>s (under <code><link
                        linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code>). If no
                  thought has been given to tokenization, this element should be left empty.</para>
               <para>There are, in general, two ways to approach tokenization.</para>
               <para>The first, and most common in TAN, treats words purely as locators, not as
                  linguistic concepts. This mirrors ordinary discourse where we tell people to find
                  a specific place in the text, e.g., "Please look at the fourth word in this
                  sentence." Normally we do not consider the linguistic context in either giving or
                  acting on such commands, although this leaves ambiguity, when we are uncertain
                  whether to treat "pom pom", "New York", or "macro-processor" as one or two
                  words.</para>
               <para>In the TAN format, "word" means merely an arbitrary string of characters
                  defined by means of a TAN-R-tok tokenization pattern (discussed fully at <link
                     linkend="tan-r-tok"/>). That pattern specifies exactly what separates one word
                  from another. The most common separators are white space and white space in
                  conjunction with punctuation. These two patterns are used so widely that they are
                  assigned reserved keywords for the <code><link linkend="attribute-which"
                        >@which</link></code> of <code><link
                        linkend="element-recommended-tokenization"
                        >&lt;recommended-tokenization></link></code>:
                     <code>general-words-only-1</code> and <code>general-1</code>.</para>
               <para>A second approach to tokenization attempts to align the locator system with
                  linguistic units such as morphemes and lexemes. This is the case where you are
                  intending to allow your transcription to be easily handled for morphological or
                  syntactic analysis. In those cases, you are willing to prepare your transcription
                  such that the morphemes and lexemes are defined by a consistent pattern.</para>
               <para>For cases such as this, one reserved keyword is available,
                     <code>precise-1</code>, which defines the word separator to be any white space
                  in conjunction with  U+200B (ZERO-WIDTH SPACE = [ZWS]). It is recommended that the
                  latter be spelled out with its XML entity, <code>&amp;#x200B;</code>, so that
                  editors and readers of the text can easily see where these markers have been set.
                  In display, however, the ZWS will not introduce space between characters.</para>
               <para>It is up to other users to decide whether to adopt your recommendations or not.
                  In the end, TAN tokenization is a reference system, intended for the convenience
                  of the user. There are ways in class 2 files to take a given tokenization system
                  and redefine an individual token down to the character level.</para>
               <para>You may have as many <code><link linkend="element-recommended-tokenization"
                        >&lt;recommended-tokenization></link></code>s as you like, but the best
                  should be placed first. </para>

               <para>Generally speaking, normalization should entails the suppression of such
                  elements extraneous to the work you have chosen. You should feel free to omit
                  parenthetical editorial insertions, stray handwritten remarks, discretionary
                  word-breaking hyphens, editorial comments, inserted cross-references, and
                  reference numerals (page numbers, section numbers, etc.). In addition, you may
                  wish to resolve ligatures and to correct unintended typographical errors. </para>
               <para>In a digital source, variable lengths of spacing marks (e.g., General
                  Punctuation U+2000..U+200A; U+200B) should be converted to ordinary spaces (unless
                  if using precise-1 method of tokenzation; see <xref
                     linkend="preparing_transcriptions_for_tokenization"/>), and superscript
                  combining Roman letters (U+0363..U+036F) should probably be converted to their
                  non-combining counterparts. All Unicode must be normalized to NFC forms (see <xref
                     linkend="normalization"/>). </para>
               <para>You should remove from the text anything that is not part of the work proper
                  and would interfere with detailed word-for-word alignment, or would create many
                  extra hours of preprocessing or postprocessing work for later users. If your

                  <para>Take for example a work that is structured into books, chapters, and finally

                     resume the previous one. For example, chapters 24 and 30 in the book of
                     Proverbs of the Septuagint are split in half and collated. The sequence goes as
                     follows: 24.1 - 24.22e (22a - 22e are verses not extant in the Hebrew); 30.1 -
                     30.14; 24.23 - 24.34; and 30.15 - 30.33. If the uniqueness rule applied

                        <xref linkend="xml"/>, which addresses some technical issues that relate to

               </note>
            </para>
            <para>Some creators and editors of transcriptions will find the rather stripped-down
               TAN-T format inadequate. Some may wish to mark up the text in leaf <code><link
                     linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s. Others may already have a
               library of transcriptions with detailed annotations that are desirable to keep, even
               if TAN users may not be interested. To serve these needs, TAN has adopted the Text
               Encoding Intiative (TEI) format for its expressiveness, its stability, its
               flexibility, and its widespread use in scholarship.</para>
            <para>TEI is one of the best known XML encoding formats for textual markup. It was
               designed to be maximally expressive and flexible, to serve the most robust needs of
               humanities scholars. In serving this mission, TEI has come to define more than five
               hundred different element names, and more than two hundred attributes. Of course, any
               given TEI file uses only a small subset of those elements and attributes, and TEI
               itself comes in different sizes, from TEI Lite, which uses only 75 attributes and 140
               elements, to TEI All, which opens up almost the entire library. </para>
            <para>The TEI has been designed to be customizable, which is actively encouraged.
               Individuals and projects may define their own subset of TEI elements, to constrict or
               expand the allowable rules as they see fit. TAN-TEI is one of those customizations,
               adjusting the TEI rules to ensure that the transcriptions are interchangeable and
               suitable with all other TAN files.</para>
            <para>The customization of the TEI can be summarized as follows (the default namespace
               in this section is the TEI namespace,

                     linkend="attribute-n">@n</link></code>.</para>
            <para>Within any leaf <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>, you may
               use whatever TEI markup you wish, to whatever level of depth or complexity. All users
               of your TAN-TEI file will be interested in the text nodes, but only a subset will
               care about any markup within leaf <code><link linkend="element-div"
                  >&lt;div></link></code>s. For this reason, even if you change the value of
                     <code><link linkend="attribute-xmllang">@xml:lang</link></code> within a leaf
                     <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>, there is no guarantee
               that readers or processors of your data will take it into account. Or if you try to
               represent the physical appearance of the text on the object, it is likely to be
               ignored. TAN rules on normalizing space and Unicode characters also prevails over any
               exemptions declared in TEI.</para>
            <para>As a matter of practicality, it is helpful to envision the TEI to TAN-TEI

         <title>Class 2 TAN Files, Annotations of Texts</title>
         <para>This chapter is devoted to the class 2 format, which treats annotations of class 1
            files. At present, class 2 files are restricted to alignment or
            lexico-morphology.</para>
         <para>Alignment files come in two different formats, identified by the rootmost element.
            TAN-A-div is macroscopic; TAN-A-tok, microscopic. TAN-A-div aligns one or more class 1
            files. It is intended for broad, general alignments of any number of versions of any
            number of works. TAN-A-tok allows one to declare alignments with detailed specificity,
            certainty, and type between any two class 1 files. </para>
         <para>Lexico-morphology files (also called part-of-speech files), TAN-LM, are used to
            encode the lexical headwords and morphological forms of individual words in class 1
            files.</para>
         <section xml:id="class_2_common">
            <title>Common Elements</title>
            <para>The class 2 formats have been designed to be very readable to humans. And because
               that data invariably points to class 1 files, it has been assumed that those
               references should reflect the way, in ordinary conversation, we refer to specific
               parts of a text. We like to cite pages, paragraphs, sentences, lines, words, letters,
               and so forth, and to keep our references managable we include relative keywords, and
               sometimes portions of the text itself. We might say, for example, "See page 4, second
               paragraph, the last four words." Or, "See page 4, second paragraph, first sentence,
               second occurence of 'pull'." </para>
            <para>We generally find it difficult if not impossible to construct and interpret "See
               characters 2496-2502, 2504-2509, and 2510-2512." Although it is easy for a computer
               to parse such numbers, TAN avoids these kinds of constructions.</para>
            <para>The TAN syntax for referring to portions of text has a few unavoidable
               constraints. First, the reference system used by each source file must be respected,
               although some ad hoc alterations are allowed (see below). Second, TAN is commited to
               XML-based space normalization, which means that editors need to have the freedom to
               alter indentation and spacing as needed. So it is impossible to point to changable
               features in a source file such as line or character numbers. So TAN references to
               class 1 files depend upon fixed features: works, divisions, word tokens, and
               characters. <emphasis>Works</emphasis>, defined above (see <xref
                  linkend="conceptual_works"/>), are invoked by virtue of declaring a
                  <emphasis>source</emphasis> because no source may have more than one work.
                  <emphasis>Divisions</emphasis> are defined by the <code><link
                     linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> structure of each class 1
               transcription. <emphasis>Tokens</emphasis> are words defined according to one or more
               tokenization rules. And <emphasis>characters</emphasis> are defined, when possible,
               by the codepoints that make up a particular word token.</para>
            <para>This fourfold hierarchy—sources, divisions, tokens, and characters—follow a
               vocabulary that the editor of a class 2 file finds most useful. Sources are given a
               nickname (e.g., <code><link linkend="attribute-xmlid">xml:id</link> =
                  "hamlet-1741"</code>); the identifying labels for division types and labels are
               adopted from the class 1 sources (e.g., <code><link linkend="attribute-ref"
                     >ref</link> = "Act I scene 1"</code>), or they can be provisionally adjusted;
               word tokens can be referred to by position (counting from the beginning or end of a
                     <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>) or by its actual
               value (e.g., <code><link linkend="attribute-pos">ord</link> = "1 - 5" <link
                     linkend="attribute-val">val</link> = "hath"</code>; see <xref
                  linkend="attr_pos_and_val"/>). Characters are always identified by number (e.g.,
                     <code><link linkend="attribute-chars">chars</link> = "2, 7"</code>).</para>
            <para>This approach not only makes the syntax human readable, it also mitigates any
               disruptions that corrections or alterations might incur. For example, if an
               incorrectly duplicated is deleted, disruption to the reference system is restricted
               to that particular <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> and does
               not affect the rest of the document.</para>

               <para>Class 2 files share a few common features in their metadata, mostly to
                  facilitate the human-friendly reference system outlined above.</para>
               <para>All class 2 files have as their sources nothing other than class 1 files.
                  Therefore each <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code> must
                  take only a single <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> that
                  carries the IRI name of the source TAN-T(EI) file, and at least one <code><link
                        linkend="element-location">&lt;location></link></code>. Because the rights
                  have already been declared in the source files, <code><link
                        linkend="element-rights-source-only">&lt;rights-source-only></link></code>
                  is disallowed. </para>
               <para>Most class 2 files must be able to name or number word-tokens in a
                  transcription. All class 2 files that require tokenization (i.e., TAN-A-tok and
                  TAN-LM) must have under <code><link linkend="element-declarations"
                        >&lt;declarations></link></code> one or more <code><link
                        linkend="element-tokenization">&lt;tokenization></link></code>s that can be
                  applied to every language in every source. Tokenizations may or may not be those
                  recommended by a source. They can be standard TAN tokenizations, or completely
                  different TAN-R-tok files. See <code><link linkend="element-tokenization"
                        >&lt;tokenization></link></code>, <xref

                     linkend="tan-r-tok"/>.</para>
               <para>There may be some cases where a source has a div type that is extraneous to
                  referencing the text. A single optional <code><link
                        linkend="element-suppress-div-types">&lt;suppress-div-types></link></code>
                  may be used to specify division types that you wish to suppress in
                  references.</para>
               <para xml:id="implicit-div-type-refs">Optional <code><link
                        linkend="element-implicit-div-type-refs"

                        linkend="attribute-src">@src</link></code>) that will be referred to with a
                  brief syntax where div types are omitted (e.g., <code><link
                        linkend="attribute-ref">ref</link> = "I 1"</code> instead of <code><link
                        linkend="attribute-ref">ref</link> = "Act I scene 1"</code>). Even if a
                  source recommends the implicit reference system, it must be explicitly declared
                  through <code><link linkend="element-implicit-div-type-refs"
                        >&lt;implicit-div-type-refs></link></code>.</para>

                  convenient way to provisionally rename <code><link linkend="attribute-n"
                     >@n</link></code> and <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>
                  values. This is useful for cases where you wish to use division labels that more
                  familiar to users of the class 2 files, or are easier to edit and read. </para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-rename-div-ns">&lt;rename-div-ns></link></code>
                  can be used to harmonize discordant <code><link linkend="attribute-n"
                     >@n</link></code> values. This is especially helpful for divs that are named,
                  not numbered, such as the books of the Bible, or to declare a change from Roman
                  and alphabetic numbering systems into Arabic. But that is strictly speaking a
                  convenience, not a necessity, since TAN-compliant preprocessors are required to
                  automatically detect Roman and alphabetic numbering systems and treat them as if
                  Arabic numerals.</para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-rename-div-ns">&lt;rename-div-ns></link></code>
                  has potentially more impact than <code><link linkend="element-rename-div-types"
                        >&lt;rename-div-types></link></code>. The latter points to division types
                  that are defined by the <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code>
                  value under <code><link linkend="element-div-type">&lt;div-type></link></code>.
                  Changing the name of the div type does not change the underlying definition. But
                  changing the value of <code><link linkend="attribute-n">@n</link></code>
                  effectively changes the actual value, so any changes in <code><link
                        linkend="element-rename-div-ns">&lt;rename-div-ns></link></code> must
                  preserve the Leaf Div Uniqueness Rule. Furthermore, in a TAN-A-div file, this kind
                  of renaming changes any default alignments. See <xref linkend="tan-a-div"
                  />.</para>

               <para>The three types of class 2 files treat different kinds of phenomena, so their
                  data looks quite different. Nevertheless, a few elements and attributes are shared
                  by two or more formats.</para>
               <para>Many class 2 elements take <code><link linkend="attribute-src"
                     >@src</link></code> and <code><link linkend="attribute-ref">@ref</link></code>.
                        <code><link linkend="attribute-src">@src</link></code> points via ID
                  reference to one ore more <code><link linkend="element-source"

                     >@ref</link></code> points to one or more <code><link linkend="element-div"
                        >&lt;div></link></code>s through their <emphasis>flattened
                     references</emphasis>. A flattened reference is the concatenated value of the
                        <code><link linkend="attribute-type">@type</link></code>s and <code><link
                        linkend="attribute-n">@n</link></code>s of all self and ancestral
                        <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s, joined by
                  non-word characters as delimiters, and perhaps substituted with their new values
                  if <code><link linkend="element-rename-div-types"
                     >&lt;rename-div-types></link></code> or <code><link
                        linkend="element-rename-div-ns">&lt;rename-div-ns></link></code> have been
                  invoked (see <xref linkend="metadata_head"/>).</para>
               <para>In the example <code><link linkend="attribute-ref">ref</link> = "bk.1:ch.2 -
                     bk.1:ch.4"</code>, the delimiters of colon and period are arbitrary. You may
                  use any punctuation you wish, but it is recommended you use what will be most
                  familiar to users. Question marks, hyphens, and commas are not recommended, since
                  the first is reserved for requesting assistance and the last two, for creating
                  ranges of references. Further, the comma in most contexts means "and". That is, it
                  joins like things and is paratactic. But delimiting punctuation is
                  hypotactic.</para>
               <para>In most cases, <code><link linkend="attribute-ref">@ref</link></code> may point
                  to multiple <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s, constructed
                  by taking two or more flattened references and joining them with a hyphen
                     <code>-</code> for range or a comma <code>,</code> for union. In any range, the
                  reference on the left should precede the one on the right in the source document.
                  For example, <code>bk.3:c.4:s.2 - bk.3:c.4:s.4, bk.3:c.4:s.8</code> and
                     <code>3:4:2 - 3:4:4, 3:4:8</code> are correct ways to refer to sections 2, 3,
                  4, and 8 of the fourth chapter of book three. </para>
               <para>In some cases, a range of references must be siblings (i.e., <code>bk.3 -
                     bk.3:c.4:s.4</code> would be disallowed), as, for example, in elements for
                  which <code><link linkend="attribute-distribute">@distribute</link></code> (<xref
                     linkend="attr_distribute"/>) is <code>true</code>.</para>
               <para><code><link linkend="attribute-chars">@chars</link></code> and <code><link
                        linkend="attribute-pos">@pos</link></code> follow a useful compact syntax,
                  described below (<xref linkend="attr_pos_and_val"/>).</para>
               <para>It is helpful to think about these attributes in the context of <code><link
                        linkend="element-tok">&lt;tok></link></code>, which appears in all class 2
                  formats. This element points to individual words in one or more sources, in or
                  more references, calculated distributively. For example, <code>&lt;<link
                        linkend="element-tok">tok</link> src = "a b c" <link linkend="attribute-ref"
                        >ref</link> = "bk.1:ch.2 - bk.1:ch.4" <link linkend="attribute-pos"
                        >ord</link> = "1 - 3"/></code>, points to three sources, three, references,
                  and three ordinal positions of words, and so points to twenty-seven words
                  total.</para>

                           For example, <code>2, 4 - 6, last-2 - last</code> refers to the second,
                           fourth, fifth, sixth, antepenult, penult, and final tokens in a sequence

                           are picked. For example, <code><link linkend="attribute-val"
                              >@val</link>="bird" <link linkend="attribute-pos">@pos</link>="2,

               <para>If <code><link linkend="attribute-pos">@pos</link></code> points to an ordinal

            <title>Alignments: Principles and Assumptions</title>
            <para>At the heart of class 2 are alignment files. TAN distinguishes two types of
               alignment. </para>
            <para>The first, aiming at breadth and extent, collects multiple versions of a work to
               facilitate parallel reading or research, much like the Rosetta Stone or Origen's
                  <emphasis role="italic">Hexapla</emphasis>. This macroscopic alignment is normally
               constructed to help readers notice and study similarities and differences among
               multiple versions of texts. </para>
            <para>The second, aiming at depth and precision, isolates two versions of a work and
               documents how and why certain letters, words, or phrases in one version were omitted,
               retained, or changed in the other, much like very precise, detailed commentaries on
               texts and their translations, or apparatus critici in critical editions.</para>
            <para>Just as these two types of aligning activities are separate, so they are also in
               their TAN formats. One, <emphasis role="bold">TAN-A-div</emphasis>, facilitates the
               general alignment of any number of class 1 files; the other, <emphasis role="bold"
                  >TAN-A-tok</emphasis>, the detailed alignment of any two. For cases where both
               precision and breadth are required, one or more of each type of format should be
               written.</para>
            <para>TAN aligments attest to acts of translating, paraphrasing, revising, quoting,
               summarizing, and so forth. All these are treated as types of text reuse, where one or
               more texts, usually called in translation studies the <emphasis>source</emphasis> (or
                  <emphasis>sources</emphasis>), are transformed into a new text, customarily called
               the <emphasis>target</emphasis>. Text reuse has directionality and is asymmetrical.
               But many times we deal with texts where the original lines of direction are contested
               or unknown. In those cases, it is hasty or misleading to refer to either of the texts
               as a source or a target. Indeed, the two texts may in fact derive from a common
               source, or be only indirectly related, the result of multiple generations of copying
               and translating. In these guidelines, therefore, we avoid the term <emphasis
                  role="italic">target</emphasis> altogether, and when we use the word <emphasis
                  role="italic">source</emphasis>, we are referring only to one of the class 1 files
               upon which a class 2 alignment depends.</para>
            <para>Consequently, the order of <code><link linkend="element-source"
                  >&lt;source></link></code>s in an alignment file's <code><link
                     linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code> does not imply chronological
               precedence. All the sequence implies is processing order, so the first will be the
               foundation or base against which subsequent sources will be aligned. It is usually a
               good idea to list as the first <code><link linkend="element-source"
                     >&lt;source></link></code> the version that is most complete or most important
               to a given alignment.</para>
            <para>Take for example a work such as the <emphasis role="italic">Chronicle of the
                  Morea</emphasis>, a fourteenth century history, which survives in both French and
               Greek versions. The original language of composition is disputed. A TAN-A file that
               lists the Greek source first and the French second does not imply that the text was
               written in Greek. All it means is that anyone processing the TAN file should begin
               with the Greek before going to the Latin.</para>

            <title>Division-Based Alignments (<code><link linkend="element-TAN-A-div">&lt;TAN-A-div></link></code>)</title>
            <para>TAN-A-div is the format for macroscopic, division-based alignment, and is
               dedicated to aligning any number of versions of any number of works on the basis of
                     <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s, or even smaller, ad
               hoc segments in the sources invoked. </para>
            <para>A TAN-A-div file is technically not an alignment per se. Rather, it is an
               alignment constructor. That is, a TAN-A-div file specifies the core parameters
               necessary in creating an alignment. It is up to a processor to use that TAN-A-div
               file to generate a byproduct (HTML, pdf, word processing document, etc.) that will be
               recognizable to most people as an alignment.</para>
            <para>Some independently created transcriptions of the same work will, no matter the
               good intentions of the transcribers, fail to correspond exactly to other versions of
               the same works. Perhaps the works or div types will not be defined identically, or
               perhaps one version follows a reference system at odds with the majority of other
               versions. TAN-A-div is used to reconcile such inconsistencies, to make special
               alignments that a computer might not be able to detect automatically, and to refine
               the alignment of parallel sources, even down to the word level. </para>
            <para>The assumptions of an aligner are opaque in the TAN-A-div format. A TAN-A-div file
               says, in essence, "Please align the following sources," but it does not say why the
               alignment is requested, and it does not indicate what relationship holds between the
               various sources. In fact, a TAN-A-div file could be used to align texts that have no
               apparent relationship (to what end would be unclear). If it is important to convey
               assumptions about the rationale for alignment, the TAN-A-tok format should be
               used.</para>
            <para>Any processor of a TAN-A-div format should assume greedy alignment. Alignments
               should be inferred wherever possible, when not explicitly overridden. Alignments are
               also transitive. If passage A aligns with B, then anything that aligns with A must
               align with anything that aligns with B.</para>

               <title>Rootmost Element and Header</title>
               <para>The rootmost element of a TAN division-based alignment file is
                     <code><link linkend="element-TAN-A-div">&lt;TAN-A-div></link></code>.</para>
               <para>Under <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>, some special rules apply to TAN-A-div

               <para>One or more <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code>s must be declared (<xref
                     linkend="source_and_see-also"/>). An alignment file with only a single source
                  may seem at first strange, but it may be useful for self-alignment (i.e., to
                  indicate places where a source reuses itself). </para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code> takes zero or more of the declarations common to

               <para>A TAN-A-div may have an empty <code><link linkend="element-body"
                        >&lt;body></link></code> because the format by default demands greedy
                  alignment. That is, it states, in effect, "Take the list of sources in the header.
                  First group (align) them by work, then by <code><link linkend="element-div"
                        >&lt;div></link></code>s according to flattened references." </para>
               <para>A processor will create groups of works by looking for matches in the sources'
                        <code><link linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> values under
                        <code><link linkend="element-work">&lt;work></link></code>. To those matches
                  will be added any sources you claim should be treated as being equivalently the
                  same work. Then within each work group, the processor will standardize the
                        <code><link linkend="attribute-type">@type</link></code> and <code><link
                        linkend="attribute-n">@n</link></code> values that make up each leaf
                        <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>'s reference, first
                  by finding common <code><link linkend="element-div-type"
                     >&lt;div-type></link></code>s through the sources' <code><link
                        linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> values, and second by
                  normalizing any nonstandard numeration systems. The resultant normalization is
                  then used to create groups of leaf <code><link linkend="element-div"
                        >&lt;div></link></code>s that share the same flattened reference numbers.
                  (See <xref linkend="leaf_div_uniqueness_rule"/>.)</para>
               <para>If sources to be aligned share <code><link linkend="element-IRI"
                        >&lt;IRI></link></code> values for <code><link linkend="element-work"
                        >&lt;work></link></code>s and <code><link linkend="element-div-type"
                        >&lt;div-type></link></code>s, and use a common labeling system (<code><link
                        linkend="attribute-n">@n</link></code>), then nothing needs to be declared
                  in a TAN-A-div <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>. A
                  TAN-conformant processor will construct an alignment wherever it can. </para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>, therefore, is used
                  exclusively to reconcile unwanted differences between source TAN-T(EI) files, to
                  realign versions of the same work, and to declare new alignments across works
                  (quotations). It does so in a five-step process. Each step is optional and
                  sequence-specific. That is, each statement assumes declarations made in previous
                  siblings have already been taken into account. Each of these steps allow an
                  optional <xref linkend="edit_stamp"/> (therefore not mentioned in the description
                  below).</para>
               <para>The five steps involved in creating the <code><link linkend="element-body"
                        >&lt;body></link></code> for a TAN-A-div file are, in general, rather
                  simple. But some of the descriptions that follow may seem unnecessarily detailed
                  or complex. You are advised to consult examples found in the detailed description
                  of individual elements and attributes.</para>
               <section>
                  <title>Step 1: Correlate Works</title>
                  <para>In the first step you may declare an ad hoc equivalence between sources that
                     do not already share an <code><link linkend="element-IRI"
                        >&lt;IRI></link></code> value for <code><link linkend="element-work"
                           >&lt;work></link></code>. Each equivalence is made through an <code><link
                           linkend="element-equate-works">&lt;equate-works></link></code>, which
                     groups together under <code><link linkend="attribute-src">@src</link></code>
                     the ids of sources that should be treated as containing the same work. </para>
                  <para>Transitive alignment holds: <code>&lt;<link linkend="element-equate-works"
                           >equate-works</link>
                        <link linkend="attribute-src">src</link>="a b"/></code> means that any
                     source that shares the same work as <code>a</code> will be treated as the same
                     work as any source defined to be the same work as <code>b</code>.</para>
                  <para>This declaration does not imply that the works are, in reality, one and the
                     same. It merely states that, for the purposes of this alignment, they should be
                     treated as equivalent.</para>

               <section>
                  <title>Step 2: Correlate Division Types</title>
                  
                  
                  <para>This second step does for div types what the first step did for works.
                     Across all sources, every <code><link linkend="element-div-type"
                           >&lt;div-type></link></code> that shares an <code><link
                           linkend="element-IRI">&lt;IRI></link></code> value will be treated as
                     equivalent. But you may augment that automated alignment through an <code><link
                           linkend="element-equate-div-types">&lt;equate-div-types></link></code>,
                     which takes one or more <code><link linkend="element-div-type-ref"
                           >&lt;div-type-ref></link></code>s, each of which takes a mandatory
                           <code><link linkend="attribute-src">@src</link></code> and <code><link
                           linkend="attribute-div-type-ref">@div-type-ref</link></code>, to point to
                     one or more sources and division types. You must use either the <code><link
                           linkend="attribute-xmlid">@xml:id</link></code> assigned by the source to
                     that div type or its renamed value, if there is a corresponding <code><link

                     under <code><link linkend="element-declarations"
                        >&lt;declarations></link></code> (see <xref linkend="class_2_metadata"

                  <para>As with <code><link linkend="element-equate-works"

                     assume a greedy, transitive alignment. And this ad hoc declaration does not
                     imply that the two types of division are, in reality, one and the same.</para>

                  <title>Step 3: Refine Segmentation</title>
                  
                  
                  <para>Suppose you have two transcriptions where a phrase ending one leaf
                           <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> in source A
                     actually corresponds to the beginning phrase of the next leaf <code><link
                           linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> in source B. Or suppose that
                     you wish to break down a leaf <code><link linkend="element-div"
                        >&lt;div></link></code> into smaller constituent parts, to facilitate more
                     exact alignments (e.g., sentence-to-sentence, phrase-to-phrase, word-to-word).
                     Before these refined alignments can occur, the source transcriptions must be
                     refined by first segmenting specific leaf <code><link linkend="element-div"
                           >&lt;div></link></code> . This is done through <link
                        linkend="element-split-leaf-div-at">&lt;split-leaf-div-at></link>,
                     containing one ore more <code><link linkend="element-tok"
                        >&lt;tok></link></code>s pointing to individual words (see <xref
                        linkend="attr_pos_and_val"/>) that should begin a new segment in each
                     reference in each source. Hence the first token in a leaf <code><link
                           linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> may never be picked as the
                     start of a new segment.</para>
                  <para><code><link linkend="attribute-ref">@ref</link></code> must refer only to
                     leaf <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s. Any leaf
                           <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> may be split as
                     many times as one wishes.</para>

                  <para>After step 3, some of the divisions and segments of a work may not be
                     properly aligned. Segments newly created by <code><link
                           linkend="element-split-leaf-div-at">&lt;split-leaf-div-at></link></code>s
                     may need to be realigned. Or perhaps one of the sources uses a reference system
                     that is out of step with the others. </para>
                  <para><code><link linkend="element-realign">&lt;realign></link></code> is used to
                     reconcile the parts of versions of the same work. It is not used for aligning
                     across works (see step 5, below). </para>
                  <para>There are two types of realignment: anchored and unanchored, discussed in
                     detail at <code><link linkend="element-realign"
                     >&lt;realign></link></code>.</para>

                  <title>Step 5: Add New Alignments</title>
                  <para>At this point, the versions of each work should be aligned. You are now in a
                     position to indicate places where one work aligns with another, to supplement
                     the aligments that will be inferred from steps 1 through 4. </para>
                  <para>In this fifth step, <code><link linkend="element-align"
                        >&lt;align></link></code> is used to indicate where one work quotes another
                     or itself. Every group of references, defined by children <code><link
                           linkend="element-div-ref">&lt;div-ref></link></code>, is to be aligned
                     with every other group of references, qualified by some optional
                     attributes:</para>
                  <para><code><link linkend="attribute-strength">@strength</link></code> (default =
                     1) is a rough equivalent to <code><link linkend="attribute-cert"
                        >@cert</link></code>, but makes no claim on doubt. After all, TAN-A-div
                     files do not furnish a mechanism to indicate the reason why the sources are
                     being aligned (e.g., quotation, translation), and so do not admit any doubt. To
                     align a text is to do it with certitude, and without claims for the rationale
                     for the alignment. </para>
                  <para><code><link linkend="attribute-exclusive">@exclusive</link></code> (default
                     = false) indicates whether an alignment should be excluded or not from
                     transitive alignments. If transitive alignments are allowed, then each
                           <code><link linkend="element-div-ref">&lt;div-ref></link></code> may take
                     only one value for <code><link linkend="attribute-src">@src</link></code>, to
                     minimize potential confusion in what is, in effect, a redundancy.</para>
                  <para xml:id="attr_distribute"><code><link linkend="attribute-distribute"
                           >@distribute</link></code> (default = false), indicates whether the
                     references declared in a <code><link linkend="element-div-ref"
                           >&lt;div-ref></link></code> should be interpreted as a group or
                     individually (every nth item to be matched against the nth item in every other
                           <code><link linkend="element-div-ref">&lt;div-ref></link></code>).</para>
                  <para>Any <code><link linkend="element-div-ref">&lt;div-ref></link></code> that is
                     a child of an <code><link linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code> may
                     take the optional <code><link linkend="attribute-strength"
                        >@strength</link></code>. (If not present, the value is assumed to be
                        <code>1</code>, or the value is inherited.) This feature is helpful when you
                     wish to indicate in a quotation that one set of references does not align as
                     strongly with the rest of the group.</para>
                  <para>An <code><link linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code>, in effect,
                     says, "This, this, and this group of passages from the given works are to be
                     aligned with each other." If the groups represent large blocks of text, nothing
                     is inferred about more granular alignments. The processor of a TAN-A-div may
                     determine if the alignment should be taken <emphasis>en bloc</emphasis>, or if
                     it should be refined and distributed, and upon what basis. If you wish to
                     specify how distribution should occur in a given <code><link
                           linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code>, you should create more
                     refined, individual <code><link linkend="element-align"
                        >&lt;align></link></code>s, perhaps using <code><link
                           linkend="attribute-distribute">@distribute</link></code>.</para>
                  <para>As in step 4, the order of <code><link linkend="element-div-ref"
                           >&lt;div-ref></link></code>s in an <code><link linkend="element-align"
                           >&lt;align></link></code> is immaterial. Any processor of your data will
                     handle references according to the document order of the sources, but no other
                     meaning will be inferred from the sequence of <code><link
                           linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code>.</para>

            <title>Token-Based Alignments (<code><link linkend="element-TAN-A-tok">&lt;TAN-A-tok></link></code>)</title>
            <para>TAN-A-tok files provide a microscopic view of how two texts relate to each other.
               The format is intended to allow you to specify exactly where, how, and why two
               transcriptions align, and to do so on the most granular level possible. TAN-A-tok
               files also allow you to express levels of confidence or alternative opinions.</para>
            <para>Creators and editors of TAN-A-tok files should be able to read the languages of
               their sources and to explain as precisely as possible the relationship between the
               two sources. You should be prepared to think about and specify types of textual
               reuse. TAN-A-tok files tend to be more demanding to create and edit than TAN-A-div
               files are because they reflect work that is more detailed, and therefore more
               time-consuming, than simple en masse alignment of sources.</para>
            <para>Because of the detailed nature of the inquiry, token alignment is restricted to
               two texts, referred to jointly as a <emphasis role="italic">bitext</emphasis>. Each
               half of the bitext must be a TAN-T(EI) file. It is assumed that those two sources
               share some special relationship, direct or indirect, and relate through one or more
               types of textual reuse: translation, paraphrase, commentary, and so forth. Some of
               these bitexts, such as literal translations, may line up quite nicely word for word.
               Others, such as paraphrases, may line up sporadically, vaguely, ambiguously, or, in
               places, not at all. So alignment of a bitext is oftentimes not easy, and requires you
               to think hard about assumptions you have made in two key areas: the relationship that
               holds from one source to the other and the types of reuse that was involved in
               turning one version into the other (or a common ancestor into both).</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Relationship of sources</emphasis>. Some bitexts will be
               directly related. Others will share a common distant ancestor. The history may be
               uncertain or vague. You may find it difficult if not impossible to tell whether a
               striking difference between the two source texts is to be credited/blamed on a
               translator or on an intermediary (such as an editor or redactor). What you know and
               understand about the relationship will affect how you create token alignments.
               Therefore, you must declare what you believe to be the physical relationship or
               history that connects the sources on the two text-bearing objects. It is important to
               think about the material aspect of philology, because you are trying to answer how
               object A's text relates to object B's.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Types of reuse</emphasis>. In creating a TAN-A file, you
               should think about and declare the cagories of text reuse you wish to use. Such a
               declaration tells users of your data what paradigm you bring to your analysis. You
               may wish to keep your categories nondescript and somewhat vague, using poorly
               concepts such as <emphasis>translation</emphasis>, <emphasis>paraphrase</emphasis>,
                  <emphasis>quotation</emphasis>, and so forth without offering a specific
               definition. On the other hand, you may have a specific and detailed view of text
               reuse. Perhaps you have adopted field-specific categories such as
                  <emphasis>obligatory explicitation</emphasis>, <emphasis>optional
                  explicitation</emphasis>, <emphasis>pragmatic explicitation</emphasis>, or
                  <emphasis>translation-inherent explicitation</emphasis>. You may also wish to
               declare secondary types of reuse, such as <emphasis role="italic">scribal
                  omission</emphasis> or <emphasis role="italic">dittography</emphasis>, to declare
               secondary types of reuse that may have intervened. You must declare at least one type
               of reuse.</para>

               <title>Rootmost Element and Header</title>
               <para>The rootmost element of a token-based alignment file is
                     <code><link linkend="element-TAN-A-tok">&lt;TAN-A-tok></link></code>.</para>
               <para>The TAN-A-tok header builds upon the core and class 2 headers (see <xref

               <para>TAN-A-tok files take exactly two <code><link linkend="element-source"
                        >&lt;source></link></code>s. The sequence is arbitrary, determining only the
                  order in which processors will handle the data. Each <code><link
                        linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code> must take an <code><link
                        linkend="attribute-xmlid">@xml:id</link></code>.</para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code> takes, in addition to all the elements allowed
                  in class 2 files (see <xref linkend="class_2_metadata"/>), two elements unique to
                  TAN-A-tok: <code><link linkend="element-bitext-relation">&lt;bitext-relation></link></code> and <code><link linkend="element-reuse-type">&lt;reuse-type></link></code>. The
                  first of these describes genealogical descent of the two versions, and is
                  concerned with directionality. The second avoids these categories altogether and
                  focuses on the qualitative aspect of the bitext relationship.</para>

               <title>Data (<code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>)</title>
               <para>The <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> of a TAN-A-tok
                  file takes, in addition to the customary optional attributes found in other TAN

                  and <xref linkend="edit_stamp"/>), required <code><link
                        linkend="attribute-bitext-relation">@bitext-relation</link></code> and
                        <code><link linkend="attribute-reuse-type">@reuse-type</link></code>, which

                        linkend="element-reuse-type">&lt;reuse-type></link></code>, defining the
                  default values of the alignment. </para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> has only one type of
                  child: one or more <code><link linkend="element-align">&lt;align></link></code>s,
                  each of which collects sets of <code><link linkend="element-tok"
                     >&lt;tok></link></code>s from one or both sources, known collectively as a
                     <emphasis role="italic">token cluster</emphasis>. Each token cluster in a given
                  TAN-A-tok file is valid independent of any other token cluster. They may overlap,
                  thereby reflecting the nature of translations, in which words often fall in
                  one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships. The
                  independence of token clusters allows you to register differences of opinion about
                  the same set of tokens. An <code><link linkend="element-align"
                     >&lt;align></link></code> may take an <code><link linkend="attribute-xmlid"
                        >@xml:id</link></code>, to facilitate external discussions about an
                  assertion.</para>
               <para>Unlike TAN-A-div files, under which a processor will assume automatic,
                  transitive, greedy alignment, TAN-A-tok files specify the opposite. Nothing should
                  be inferred about two texts outside of explicitly stated alignments. If a
                  TAN-A-tok file does not mention word tokens that are in a source, it does not mean
                  that they were, for example, left out of a translation. All it means is that the
                  creators and editors of the TAN-A-tok file have said nothing about the tokens. </para>
               <para>If you wish to declare that one or more words in one source were left out of a
                  translation or inserted into one, you must do so through a <emphasis role="italic"
                     >half-null alignment</emphasis>, i.e., a token cluster that has tokens from
                  only one source. That is, a half-null alignment implies—to drawn from the
                  terminology of translation studies—implicitation or explicitation of entire
                  words.</para>
               <para>Because nothing can be implied in a TAN-A-tok file, the status of
                     <code><link linkend="attribute-in-progress">@in-progress</link></code> (default = true) is very important, since it is the
                  only way to signal that you have said all you intend to say about the bitext.
                  (Remember, <code>in-progress = "false"</code> does not mean that the file is free
                  of errors, only that the entire scope of work has been finished.)</para>
               <para>A fully aligned bitext may result in a TAN-A-tok file with a very long
                        <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> (in contrast to
                  the typical TAN-A-div file). That does not mean, however, that everything in a
                  transcription <emphasis>must </emphasis>be encoded or described. In writing and
                  editing a TAN-A-tok file you do not commit you to saying everything possible about
                  the bitext. You might choose to encode only a few token clusters.</para>
               <para>If there are multiple IDs in <code><link linkend="attribute-reuse-type">@reuse-type</link></code> or
                     <code><link linkend="attribute-bitext-relation">@bitext-relation</link></code>, the union, not the intersection, of those values
                  is to be understood. For example, <code>reuse-type="trans para"</code> might be
                  used to indicate that the token cluster results from translation, paraphrase, or
                  both. </para>

            <para>TAN-LM files are used to associate words or word fragments with lexemes and
               morphological categories. They are intended primarily to facilitate research that
               depends upon alignments, but they can be valuable on their own, whether or not there
               are other versions or alignments.</para>
            <para>These files rely upon the grammatical rules declared for a given language, and
               those rules must be defined in a TAN-R-mor file. Therefore this section should be
               read in close conjunction with its companion: <xref linkend="tan-r-mor"/>).</para>
            <section>
               <title>Principles and Assumptions</title>
               <para>TAN-LM files are assumed to be applicable to texts in languages whose
                  vocabulary lends itself to grammatical and lexicographical analysis. The two areas
                  are interrelated but independent. If you wish, your TAN-LM file may contain only
                  lexemes or only morphological analyses.</para>
               <para>As an editor of a TAN-LM file you should understand the vocabulary and grammar
                  of the languages you have picked. You should have a good sense of the rules
                  established by the lexical and grammatical authorities you have chosen to follow.
                  You should be familiar with the TAN-R-mor files you have chosen.</para>
               <para>Although you must assume the point of view of a particular grammar and lexicon,
                  you need not define those authorities, nor hold to a single one. In addition, you
                  may bring to lexical analysis your own expertise and supply lexical headwords
                  unattested in printed authorities.</para>
               <para>Although TAN-LM files are simple, they can be laborious to read and write, more
                  than other types of TAN files. It is expected that an editor of a TAN-LM file will
                  find one or more tools to help create and edit the data.</para>

               <title>Rootmost Element and Header</title>
               <para>The rootmost element of a lexico-morphological file is TAN-LM.</para>
               <para>A mandatory <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code> element points to the one and only
                  TAN-T(EI) file that is the object of analysis. </para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code>
                  takes the elements common to class 2 files (see <xref linkend="class_2_metadata"
                  />. It takes two other elements unique to TAN-LM: <code><link
                        linkend="element-lexicon">&lt;lexicon></link></code> and <code><link
                        linkend="element-morphology">&lt;morphology></link></code>. Any number of
                  lexica and morphologies may be declared, without regard for order. </para>
               <para>There is, at present, no TAN format for lexica and dictionaries, although this
                  may change in the future. So even if a digital form of a dictionary is identified
                  through the <xref linkend="digital_entity_metadata"/>, no validation tests will be
                  performed. </para>
               <para>You may find that one of the existing lexical models may be a suitable
                  supplement to any TAN collections you develop. The <link

                     Framework</link>, an ISO standard (ISO-24613:2008), has defined a data model
                  for lexicons and dictionaries. The former is geared toward philology and the
                  latter toward linguistics. You may also devise your own format if neither of these
                  support aspects of lexicology that you find important.</para>

               <title>Data (<code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code>)</title>
               <para>The <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> of a TAN-LM file
                  takes, in addition to the customary optional attributes found in other TAN files
                  (see <code><link linkend="attribute-in-progress">@in-progress</link></code> and
                     <xref linkend="edit_stamp"/>), <code><link linkend="attribute-lexicon"

                        >@morphology</link></code>, to specify the default lexicon and grammar for
                  the file. <code><link linkend="attribute-lexicon">@lexicon</link></code> may point
                  either to a <code><link linkend="element-lexicon">&lt;lexicon></link></code> id or
                  to an <code><link linkend="element-agent">&lt;agent></link></code> id
                  (particularly useful for languages without good published lexica).</para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> has only one type of
                  child: one or more <code><link linkend="element-ana">&lt;ana></link></code>s
                  (short for analysis), each of which matches one or more tokens to one or more
                  lexemes or morphological assertions. </para>
               <para>If due to tokenization a linguistic token is broken up such that two different
                        <code><link linkend="element-tok">&lt;tok></link></code>s must be used, you
                  may use <code><link linkend="attribute-cont">@cont</link></code> in the first
                        <code><link linkend="element-tok">&lt;tok></link></code> to specify that it
                  continues and should be concatenated with the next one and treated as a single
                  linguistic token. </para>
               <para>If <code><link linkend="attribute-ref">@ref</link></code> or <code><link
                        linkend="attribute-pos">@pos</link></code> have multiple values then the
                        <code><link linkend="element-tok">&lt;tok></link></code> is assumed to be
                  referring to multiple tokens. But if <code><link linkend="attribute-chars"
                        >@chars</link></code> has multiple values, these are to be treated as
                  constituent parts of each word picked by <code><link linkend="attribute-ref"
                        >@ref</link></code> or <code><link linkend="attribute-pos"
                     >@pos</link></code>.</para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-tok">&lt;tok></link></code> may take an
                        <code><link linkend="attribute-xmlid">@xml:id</link></code> value, reserved
                  for use by a future class-2 format, to relate words to their larger syntactical
                  context. </para>
               <para>If a lexicon has more than one entry for a given <code><link

                        linkend="attribute-pos">@pos</link></code> may be used to specify which
                  entry or entries are meant (<xref linkend="attr_pos_and_val"/>). If <code><link
                        linkend="attribute-pos">@pos</link></code> is absent, the value is assumed
                  to be 1.</para>
               <para>The content of <code><link linkend="element-m">&lt;m></link></code> consists of
                  one or more codes, space-delimited and defined in the chosen TAN-R-mor file. For

         <para>This chapter discusses class 3 TAN files, which make declare rules about languages
            and scripts. This class, at present, consists of rules pertaining to tokenization and

            <title>Tokenization Patterns</title>
            <para>The term <emphasis role="italic">word</emphasis> is notoriously difficult to
               define for any language. In English, for example, "New York" and "didn't" can each be
               justifiably defined as one or two words. So we adopt a proximate term, <emphasis
                  role="italic">token</emphasis>. A token is essentially a word that is defined not
               linguistically but computationally, according to a regular expression, and those
               regular expressions are constructed such that matches approximate what we normally
               call words. For example, we may define a token as any continuous string of word
               characters, <code>\w+</code> (see above, <xref linkend="regular_expressions"/>). </para>
            <para>To <emphasis role="italic">tokenize</emphasis> is to segment a string into a
               sequence of tokens. The segmentation is specified by another regular expression that
               defines the pattern that separates tokens, that is, the opposite or complement set.
               The way we find the tokens made of <code>\w+</code>, our example above, is by
               tokenizing on the complement set, <code>\W+</code>.</para>
            <para>Every TAN-R-tok file is, in essence, a tokenization constructor. It describes zero
               or more preparatory replacement processes, followed by a single tokenizing command,
               so as to create a sequence of words or tokens that can then be referred to by their
               position in the sequence. This is the backbone upon which all class-2 files depend
               for referring to specific word tokens in one or more class 1 files. Because TAN-R-tok
               files are used extensively by both class 1 and class 2 files, it is important that
               you familiarize yourself with how a TAN-R-tok file will be invoked by them. See <xref
                  linkend="element-recommended-tokenization"/> and <xref linkend="tokenization"/>.</para>
            <para>Tokenization files may be either language specific or language agnostic. The
               latter are used for patterns that recur throughout languages, and are anticipated to
               be heavily used and limited in number. So for convenience, TAN provides the following
               language-agnostic TAN-R-tok files as standard, predefined rules:</para>

            <section>
               <title>Principles and Assumptions</title>
               <para>Certain assumptions and recommendations are made regarding tokenization files,
                  complementing the more general ones; see <xref linkend="design_principles"
                  />.</para>
               <para>TAN-R-tok files are used exclusively to describe how a text should first be
                  changed (if needed) and then tokenized. Editors of these files should be familiar
                  with the writing conventions of the scripts for the languages they are tokenizing
                  and with the behavior of Unicode and Regular Expressions. (See <xref
                     linkend="unicode"/> and <xref linkend="regular_expressions"/>).</para>
               <para>Decisions in tokenizing are motivated by the assumptions one makes about a
                  given language and about the questions that motivates someone to tokenize a text.
                  Some linguists prefer to treat punctuation as tokens in their own right. Others,
                  such as those who work with ancient texts (where much punctuation is erratic,
                  anachronistic, or irrelevant), may wish to suppress them altogether. </para>
               <para>A poorly chosen or constructed TAN-R-tok file can produce invalid or undesired
                  results. You should clearly document the ideal purposes of a TAN-R-tok file, both
                  through a description of contents and good examples (at least one of which is
                  required).</para>
               <para>Tokenization will be applied to one leaf <code><link linkend="element-div"
                        >&lt;div></link></code> at a time, and not to the concatenation of those
                        <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s. So if a word
                  straddles leaf <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s, it will
                  always be broken up into two or more tokens. </para>

               <para>Many TAN-R-tok files will have no <code><link linkend="element-source"

            <title>Morphological Concepts and Patterns (TAN-R-mor)</title>
            <para>TAN-R-mor files allow you to describe the morphological features of a given
               language, to assign codes of those features, and to define rules in how those codes
               may be applied. The format allows specificity, flexibility, and responsiveness.
               Assertions in the format may be doubted, rules may be expressed as contingent upon
               other coniditons, and warnings and error messages may be sent to users who may have
               used a pattern incorrectly, or not in accordance with best practices.</para>
            <para>The TAN-R-mor format is like a Schematron language for languages. That is, you may
               specify series of reports and assertions to be made, based upon how user of the
               format tries to combine morphological features. So a user is not only able to see if
               the rules have been violated, but why, and exactly where.</para>
            <para>This chapter should be read in close conjunction with that pertaining to TAN-LM
               files, which exclusively depend upon them (<xref linkend="tan-lm"/>).</para>
            <section>
               <title>Principles and Assumptions</title>
               <para>Certain assumptions and recommendations are made regarding morphology files,
                  complementing the more general ones; see <xref linkend="design_principles"
                  />.</para>
               <para>TAN-R-mor files are restricted exclusively to the description of the
                  inflectional categories that characterize a language, and to declare rules that
                  restrict how those categories can be declared or combined. Editors of these files
                  should be familiar with the grammar of the languages they are describing.</para>
               <para>The TAN-R-mor format has been designed under the assumption that word formation
                  and inflection, in any given language, can be analyzed in different ways. It is
                  also assumed that patterns of word inflection and formation can be categorized,
                  classified, named, and described. Different views on the grammatical features and
                  tendencies of a language should be declared, not suppressed. For example, not
                  everyone agrees on the number of major parts of speech in English. And among those
                  who think there are only eight, some name and define those categories in different
                  ways. A mid-twentieth-century paradigm held to a major category called <emphasis

               <para>The TAN-R-mor format has also been designed to cater to two approaches to
                  coding the morphological features of a language: structured or unstructured. </para>
               <para>Structured codes are created with a presumption of a set number of categories
                  into which various features of morphology should be combined. Structured codes
                  tend to have a set number of code elements, and usually require gaps in different
                  spots. For example, the Perseus approach to the morphological categories of Greek,
                  Latin, and other highly inflected languages dictate ten categories, with the first
                  two being the major and minor parts of speech, and the subsequent categories
                  devoted to person, number, tense, and so forth. Each word that is analyzed must
                  have a value, even if null.</para>
               <para>Morphology based on unstructured codes relies upon a single master set of tags
                  for morphological features, which can be applied in any sequence and combination
                  (other rules permitting). This approach is viable for any language, but it is most
                  often found in tagging sets for languages that have little inflection, e.g., the
                  Brown and Penn sets for English.</para>

               <title>Rootmost Element and Header</title>
               <para>The rootmost element of a morphological rule file is
                     <code><link linkend="element-TAN-R-mor">&lt;TAN-R-mor></link></code>.</para>
               <para>Zero or more <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code> elements describe the grammars or related
                  works that account for the rules declared in the TAN file. If the rules are not
                  based upon any published work, then <code><link linkend="element-source">&lt;source></link></code> may be omitted. Any
                  TAN-R-mor file without a source will assume to be based upon the personal
                  knowledge of the <code><link linkend="element-agent">&lt;agent></link></code>s who edited the file.</para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code>
                  takes two types of element, one or more <code><link linkend="element-for-lang"
                        >&lt;for-lang></link></code>s that take a standard language code (see <xref
                     linkend="language"/>) and one or more <code><link linkend="element-feature"
                        >&lt;feature></link></code>s that declare the morphological features that
                  characterize the languages being described. This forms a kind of morphological
                  alphabet from which both structured and unstructured approaches begin. </para>

               <para>The <code><link linkend="element-body">&lt;body></link></code> of a TAN-R-mor
                  file takes the customary optional attributes found in other TAN files (see
                        <code><link linkend="attribute-in-progress">@in-progress</link></code> and
                     <xref linkend="edit_stamp"/>). <code><link linkend="element-body"
                        >&lt;body></link></code> takes any number of <code><link
                        linkend="element-assert">&lt;assert></link></code>, <code><link
                        linkend="element-report">&lt;report></link></code>, <code><link
                        linkend="element-category">&lt;category></link></code> (if relying upon
                  structured codes), or <code><link linkend="element-option"
                     >&lt;option></link></code>s. </para>
               <para>Very generally, <code><link linkend="element-option">&lt;option></link></code>
                  allows the means either to rename <link linkend="element-feature"
                        ><code>&lt;feature></code></link>s or to provide individual members of a
                        <code><link linkend="element-category">&lt;category></link></code>.</para>
               <para><code><link linkend="element-category">&lt;category></link></code> allows you
                  to sort <link linkend="element-feature"><code>&lt;feature></code></link>s into
                  groups. This technique may be useful for languages that have numerous
                  morphological features that are traditionally grouped to support complex codes. A
                  common way to handle the morphology of Greek, for example, is through a
                  ten-character code that indicates the major part of speech, person, number, and so
                  forth. This requires users of the TAN-R-mor file to respect the order in which
                  various codes appear.</para>
               <para>This approach is only optional and probably not the best way to declare the
                  morphological features of a language. By dispensing with <code><link
                        linkend="element-category">&lt;category></link></code>, you allow users to
                  access the <link linkend="attribute-xmlid"><code>@xml:id</code></link> value of
                     <link linkend="element-feature"><code>&lt;feature></code></link> directly, and
                  to list features in any order they wish.</para>
               <para>The values and combinations can be constrained through <code><link
                        linkend="element-assert">&lt;assert></link></code> and <code><link
                        linkend="element-report">&lt;report></link></code> declarations, which are
                  used to declare rules that must be followed, or must never be used, in any
                  dependent TAN-LM file. </para>
               <para>An <code><link linkend="element-assert">&lt;assert></link></code> and
                        <code><link linkend="element-report">&lt;report></link></code> may be
                  restricted to specific features through <code><link

         <title>Experimental TAN files, RDF Assertions</title>
         <para>Many projects using the TAN format will find the need to include in their workflow
            declarations about related concepts, and to include that in their workflow. In many
            cases, there are adequate formats that are available. At other times, you may want to
            encode your information in a format much like your other TAN files. For those cases, an
            experimental format, TAN-X, is provided.</para>
         <para>The concept is relatively simple: allow a user to make RDF-compliant declarations
            about concepts invoked, but never defined in the TAN format. Take, for example, two TAN
            files, where one is a commentary or set of notes on the other. Properly speaking, each
            TAN-T(EI) file should define the work differently. But you want to be able to indicate
            that one work is a set of annotations or comments to the other. In such a case, you
            would write a separate TAN-X file that declares this relationship, and you would point
            to that TAN-X file in the two transcription files, via a computer-readable form of
                  <code><link linkend="element-desc">&lt;desc></link></code> under <code><link

         <title>Built-in Editorial Aids for TAN Files</title>
         <para>Editing any XML file can be a chore. Perhaps a file is invalid, and for unclear
            reasons. Or perhaps you are trying to add values that are found in other files, and you
            do not want to leave your editing context to find those values, copy them, return to
            where you were editing, and paste them.</para>
         <para>This chapter is devoted to documenting TAN-supported editorial assistance. For select
            TAN formats, a lightweight schematron file is provided as an auxiliary, predictably
            constructed by inserting <code>-edit</code> just before the <code>.sch</code>. If you
            are working with very large or complex files where the main validation is
            time-consuming, you may suppress the official validation schematron file and use only
            the editing schematron until you are ready to validate everything. At that point restore
            the official Schematron schema and validate as you would normally.<example>

         <title>Best Practices in Creating and Editing TAN Files</title>
         <para>Filenames: Class 1: good idea to construct a filename that starts with an acronym for
            the work, followed by the language code, then the date or editor's last name. If you
            think you're going to branch it off into different editions, then provide a version
            number at the end. Class 2 files are tougher, because you want to specify for TAN-A-tok
            which two versions are being compared. You might wind up with very long filenames if you
            try to include both. And for TAN-A-div, all hope is lost for specifying the names of the
            sources. But that format is really about collating works, so you may want simply to
            indicate the work or works that are being aligned. TAN-LM files should adopt the name of
            their one and only source, but make clear that they are LM files. Class 3: TAN-R-mor:
            start with the language code then the namespace of the document's @id then a version
            number. TAN-R-tok: tok + description + version number.</para>
         <para>If you have a text with notes, distinguish between whether the notes are intrinsic or
            extrinsic to the work. </para>
         <para>If the former, treat them as such and give them <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s. But don't try
            to keep everything in document order. That is, either put notes at the end of every
            relevant div, or put them all the way at the end of the work. And you can also probably
            delete the note signals. You can use self-alignment to make sure that notes are pegged
            to their proper place. And there you have the opportunity to attach the note not only to
            the word or punctuation to which it is attached, but you can try to sense the entire
            range of text that the author wished the note to apply to.</para>
         <para>If the notes are not part of the work per se -- for example, translator's notes in a
            translation of a primary source -- you may treat the notes as a work in their own right.
            Just create a separate TAN file for those notes, then create an alignment file to
            correlate the notes with the translation.</para>
         <para>Remember that the note signals in the main text and in the footnote area are metadata
            meant to help readers link corresponding passages of texts. So if you've already
            accommodated those alignments through a TAN-A file, the note signals are otiose, and
            they are good candidates for normalization.</para>
         <para>What about if you are transcribing a text that has variants to the work integrated
            into the document? For example, a manuscript may have correctors' marks. Or a critical
            edition can be seen as a modern instatiation, noting where corrections and deviations
            occur. In those cases...</para>
         <para>If you are working with an XML editor that utilizes Schematron Quick Fixes, you will
            find that quite a lot of work can be saved by taking advantage of these. For specifics,
            see part II of these guidelines, where SQF tips are documented. &lt;to do: go through
            all SQFs and make sure they are documented in the guidelines.></para>

         <title>Best Practices in Managing and Sharing TAN Files</title>
         <para>Good idea to think about TAN files as resting in controlled libraries of a manageable
            size and, to you at any rate, coherent theme.</para>
         <para>Put your class 1 files in the root of the library directory. Then put your class 2 or
            class 3 files in their own subdirectory, given the name of their TAN type, e.g.,
            TAN-A-div.</para>
         <para>If class 2 or class 1 files point to other members of that same project, use a local
            URL for &lt;location>. You may wish to provide other &lt;location>s with the absolute
            URL.</para>
         <para>Put your TAN libraries in a single folder. If you import someone else's TAN library
            for local use, put it in that same folder, using a descriptor for the filename that
            makes sense to you.</para>
         <para>When you poin to external libraries, include along with the absolute URL another
            &lt;location> that points to the local version.</para>

         <para>Developers: it is advisable to process the data in two steps. The first step puts all
            the data into a simplified, normalized data set. The second step queries and arranges
            that simplified data.</para>
         <para>The first step: collect all the files that have been invoked. Normalize the data
            according to the <code><link linkend="element-declarations">&lt;declarations></link></code>s specified in the <code><link linkend="element-head">&lt;head></link></code>.
            Transcription references should be homogenized to have a common nomenclature. It may
            help to flatten the hierarchy of the transcription data into leaf
            <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code>s, i.e., pairs consisting of a leaf <code><link linkend="element-div">&lt;div></link></code> ref and
            the text values for that ref.</para>
