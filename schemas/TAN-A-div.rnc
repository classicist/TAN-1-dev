realignment =
    
    ## corrects misaligned or unaligned divisions and segments in versions of the same work. <realign> is intended to reconcile discordant reference systems by mapping <div>s from one or more sources onto the <div>s of another, treated as an anchor. The reanchored divs are then excluded from any default alignments, but they inherit the anchor's alignments. 
    
    ## Realignments come in four types.
    
    ## An UNANCHORED, ONE-SOURCE realigment consists solely of one or more <div-ref>s belonging to only one source. Any number of <div>s may be referred to by the child <div-ref>s. All <div>s referred to will be excluded from automatic alignment with every other version of the same work.
    
    ## An UNANCHORED, MULTIPLE-SOURCE realignment realigns <div>s from multiple sources. The number of <div>s per source must be identical, since these <div>s will not only be excluded from automatic alignment, but realigned with each other, with the nth <div> in each source constituting a realigned group.
    
    ## An ANCHORED, ONE-TO-ONE realignment consists of an <anchor-div-ref> that points to n <div>s, and each source invoked by the following <div-ref>s also point to n <div>s, which will be reanchored to the nth <div> in the anchor. 
    
    ## An ANCHORED ONE-TO-MANY realignment consists of an <anchor-div-ref> that points only to one <div>, and <div-ref>s that point to any number of sources and any number of <div>s. To that one anchor will be remapped each source's collection of <div>s to be reanchored. The sequence of <div>s referred to will be respected. If to an anchor A is remapped <div>s 2, 4, and 3, then  
    
    ## Realignment is disruptive, displacing any default alignment that might have been inferred in the reanchored source. Assume a case where a <div> with reference B is being realigned to an anchor with reference A. In the source to be reanchored reference A, if it exists, will be excluded from automatic alignment with the anchor, unless if it is explicitly included in a <realign>. 
    
    ## All realignment, except one-to-many anchored, is inheritable, affecting not only the specified <div>s but also their descendants. That is, if X is realigned to Y, then children in X will be automatically aligned with children in Y, based on normalized values of @n. Children of <div>s in one-to-many anchored realignments must be explicitly realigned.
    
    ## Because of the distributive nature of the realignment, every value of @ref that involves a hyphen must have siblings with balanced depth on the left and right side of the hyphen (i.e., ref="1 - 2.1" would be invalid).
    
    ## <realign> does not affect subsequent nomenclature of @ref. If in source x a <div> A is realigned with <div> B in source y, then subsequent references to the realigned <div> in source x should still use A as a value of @ref, not B.  
    
    ## The order of <realign>s is immaterial. No <realign> overwrites any other <realign>. If two <realign>s each reanchor A and B in the same source to C in the anchor, then A and B will be realigned in parallel. If one meant to say that A followed by B is to be realigned to C, then a one-to-many anchored realignment should be used.

distribute-claim =
    
    ## indicates whether div refs should be treated as groups, or if they should be matched one-to-one. 
    
    ## If @distribute is true, then every nth <div> referred to in every set (defined by a <div-ref> or a group of <div-ref>s joined by @cont) will be treated as a separate pairing/grouping. Therefore the number of references derived from @refs must be identical. (Sets must be isomorphic, each set having a bijective relationship to every other one.)
    
    ## If this attribute is false, then each set of references in a single <div-ref> (or a group of <div-ref>s joined by @cont) will be aligned or realigned as a whole against every other group, without stipulating how alignments might be refined further.
    
    ## If @distribute is not present, then if sets are isomorphic, @distribute is assumed to be true, otherwise false.
    
    ## Take for example a case where the refs "1 - 2", "a - b", and "i - ii" are to be aligned. If @distribute is false, only one alignment set is created (presumably the divisions do not match well). But if @distribute is true, or if it is missing, then two sets are created: "1, a, i" and "2, b, ii".
    
    ## In calculating the number of <div>s to be distributed, ranges in @ref are resolved shallowly. For example, ref="2 - 4 b" would be resolved something like ("2", "3", "4 a", "4 b"), not, e.g., ("2 a", "2 b", "3 a", "3 b", "4 a", "4 b").

    ## A <div-ref>, or a group of <div-ref>s joined by @cont, are treated as many groups as sources referred to. That is, <div-ref src="X Y" ... /> will be treated as shorthand for <div-ref src="X" ... /> and <div-ref src="Y" ... />.
