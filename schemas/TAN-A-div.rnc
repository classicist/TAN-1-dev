realignment =
    
    ## corrects wrongly aligned divisions and segments in versions of the same work. This element (1) exempts any divs or segments referred to in children <div-ref>s from their default alignments and (2) realigns them together as a group. Realignments have two types.
    
    ## An UNANCHORED realigment is useful for divisions that need to be removed from any automatic alignment. It consists solely of one or more <div-ref>s. The effect is (1) to sever each referenced <div> from any automatic alignment and (2) to realign each source's nth reference (div or segment) with the nth reference in every other other source, if any, invoked in the <realign>. If only one source is invoked in a <realign>, only the first effect takes place: the references are effectively severed from any automatic alignment with any other version for that source. Realignment is inherited, affecting not only the specified <div>s but their descendants too.
    
    ## An ANCHORED realignment is useful for making sure a minority of misplaced <div>s align with the majority. It begins with a single <anchor-div-ref> as the first child of <realign>, then one or more <div-ref>s. The effect is (1) to sever each referenced <div> from any automatic alignment and (2) to realign each source's nth reference (div or segment) with the nth reference in the anchor. If <anchor-div-ref> points to only one reference then all subsequent <div-ref>s will be tethered collectively to that one anchor reference.
    
    ## Unanchored <realign>s effectively sever every <div-ref> from any automatic alignment. But anchored ones do not sever automatic alignment; they merely shift it to the anchor. This method is helpful for synchronizing a few sources with the reference system followed by the majority.
    
    ## Because of the distributive nature of the realignment, every value of @ref that involves a hyphen must have siblings on the left and right side of the hyphen (i.e., ref="bk.1 - bk.2:ch.1" would be invalid).
    
    ## This element is source-specific and not subject to any transitive properties. The assertions apply only to the specific sources that are cited.
    
    ## If @seg is used, every @ref must point to a leaf <div>, and @seg must point to a valid segment defined by <split-leaf-div-at>.
    
    ## For both anchored and unanchored alignments alike, the order of <div-ref>s is immaterial.

    ## <anchor-div-ref> is always followed by one or more <div-ref>s. 
    
    ## If <anchor-div-ref> points to only one reference (i.e., @src, @ref, and @seg [if present] each have only one value) then however many references are made in subsequent <div-ref>s, they will all be realigned to that one anchor reference.
