  <define name="realignment">
    <element name="realign">
      <a:documentation>corrects wrongly aligned divisions and segments in versions of the same work. This element (1) exempts any divs or segments referred to in children &lt;div-ref&gt;s from their default alignments and (2) realigns them together as a group. Realignments have two types.</a:documentation>
      <a:documentation>An UNANCHORED realigment is useful for divisions that need to be removed from any automatic alignment. It consists solely of one or more &lt;div-ref&gt;s. The effect is (1) to sever each referenced &lt;div&gt; from any automatic alignment and (2) to realign each source's nth reference (div or segment) with the nth reference in every other other source, if any, invoked in the &lt;realign&gt;. If only one source is invoked in a &lt;realign&gt;, only the first effect takes place: the references are effectively severed from any automatic alignment with any other version for that source. Realignment is inherited, affecting not only the specified &lt;div&gt;s but their descendants too.</a:documentation>
      <a:documentation>An ANCHORED realignment is useful for making sure a minority of misplaced &lt;div&gt;s align with the majority. It begins with a single &lt;anchor-div-ref&gt; as the first child of &lt;realign&gt;, then one or more &lt;div-ref&gt;s. The effect is (1) to sever each referenced &lt;div&gt; from any automatic alignment and (2) to realign each source's nth reference (div or segment) with the nth reference in the anchor. If &lt;anchor-div-ref&gt; points to only one reference then all subsequent &lt;div-ref&gt;s will be tethered collectively to that one anchor reference.</a:documentation>
      <a:documentation>Unanchored &lt;realign&gt;s effectively sever every &lt;div-ref&gt; from any automatic alignment. But anchored ones do not sever automatic alignment; they merely shift it to the anchor. This method is helpful for synchronizing a few sources with the reference system followed by the majority.</a:documentation>
      <a:documentation>Because of the distributive nature of the realignment, every value of @ref that involves a hyphen must have siblings on the left and right side of the hyphen (i.e., ref="bk.1 - bk.2:ch.1" would be invalid).</a:documentation>
      <a:documentation>This element is source-specific and not subject to any transitive properties. The assertions apply only to the specific sources that are cited.</a:documentation>
      <a:documentation>If @seg is used, every @ref must point to a leaf &lt;div&gt;, and @seg must point to a valid segment defined by &lt;split-leaf-div-at&gt;.</a:documentation>
      <a:documentation>For both anchored and unanchored alignments alike, the order of &lt;div-ref&gt;s is immaterial.</a:documentation>
