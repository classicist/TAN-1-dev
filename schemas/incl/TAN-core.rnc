If an entity/resource lacks a suitable URL-type name, you may use or coin any other valid IRI, such as a UUID, a tag URN, or an OID. Some concepts may be difficult to find IRIs for.
    
    ## Sibling <IRI>s are to be treated as names for the same thing, not as names of different things. Nevertheless, they are not synonymous, only poecilonymic. In the terms of Web Ontology Language (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/), sibling <IRI>s cannot be assumed to share the relationship owl:sameAs, because they will draw from independent vocabularies that may define similar concepts differently.

Nevertheless, most interpretations of TAN files will draw inferences based upon the union.

It is advisable to be cautious is assigning multiple IRIs to entities.

    ## The term "work" is only loosely defined in TAN. Any text that has enough unity to be referred to in ordinary conversation as a single entity may be identified as a work. A work may be composed of other works, be a part of other works, or even overlap with other works. E.g., the Lord's Prayer, the Gospel of Luke, the Tetravengelion, the New Testament, and the Bible are all valid works, despite the complex relationship between each of them.

    element work { decl-pattern-default }
decl-vers =
    
    ## identifies the version of a work. Applicable to sources that contain multiple versions, e.g., original text and facing translations. Like <work>, <version> points to a conceptual entity, not a physical one.
    
    ## In the context of a class 1 file, the entity identified by <version> is assumed to be a version of the entity defined in <work>. In TAN-c files, however, no relationship is assumed between <version> and any putative work, unless explicitly stated in that file. 
    
    ## Very few work-versions have their own URN names. It is advisable to assign a tag URN or a UUID. If you have used an IRI for <work> that you are entitled to modify, you may wish to add a suffix that will name the version. If you need to specify exactly where on a text-bearing object a version appears, <desc> or <comment> should be used.
